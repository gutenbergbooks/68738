<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a school story; but Chiltern School
has yet to be founded and the masters and
boys who figure in the following pages have
never existed outside the author’s brain.
It is necessary to say so much, partly because
most stories of this kind have admittedly
dealt with particular schools, and partly
because many readers have very little idea
of the workings of the imaginative faculty.
At all events, when a professional man
ventures to write fiction, they insist on
seeing history or caricature, and proceed to
affix labels; for there is a general assumption
that professional men, and schoolmasters
in particular, are necessarily devoid of
imagination.</p>

<p>Once more then, Chiltern is not a real
school and its masters are not real masters.
But, though not real, they are not impossible—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
least, so the author believes. For
men, like boys, are unconsciously moulded
by their environment and tend to conform
to types; and, given a school like Chiltern,
there would probably be masters like the
Chiltern masters.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE<br />
LANCHESTER TRADITION</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE ELECTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chiltern</span> School lies just outside the sleepy
little town of the same name. Its motto
is “Providendo nec timendo,” and its colours—a
happy combination of cerise, orange, and
green—are a familiar sight in all parts of the
Empire. But the school itself, though second
to none in the opinion of Chilternians, who
should be the best judges, is not seen so
often by the general public as its colours,
because it can only be reached by a branch
line and the time-table is a difficulty. It
owes its inaccessibility to the foresight of
its governors who, at the time when railways
were invented, succeeded in keeping the
main line at a distance; so when the present
chairman comes down for Speech-day he
generally travels in a motor-car.</p>

<p>Its stone walls are grey with age or green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
with creepers. Later generations have relieved
the monotony by adding blocks of
buildings in variegated brick, and nowhere
can the genius of Sir George Honeymead,
the famous mid-Victorian architect, be studied
to greater advantage. But of recent years
taste has swung back in favour of uniformity,
and whenever a famous Old Chilternian
dies—and there are many famous Old
Chilternians—an attempt is made to perpetuate
his memory by converting the brick
into stone. The sick-house, the gymnasium,
the workshops, and the lodge have already
been transformed; and it is generally understood
that, when a certain aged statesman
is taken to his rest, the Great Hall will undergo
a similar change—unless, indeed, a new
chemical laboratory is considered to have
prior claims.</p>

<p>The school owes its existence to the
generosity of one John Buss, a local farrier,
who migrated to London in the early years
of the seventeenth century, prospered in
his business, and bequeathed a school and
a hospital to his native place. Antiquarians
have been at pains to prove that what John
Buss really did was to endow an ancient
but struggling institution that had existed
on the same site ever since Benedictine days,
and that the history of Chiltern stretches
back into the dark ages before even William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of Wykeham was born. But the long gap
between the suppression of the monasteries
and the seventeenth century is hard to bridge
satisfactorily, and John Buss is still regarded,
officially, as the creator of the famous school.
The property which he bequeathed in East
London has of late years greatly deteriorated
in value, and, when the prior claims of the
hospital have been met, the school only nets
£92 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> per annum out of the endowments.
The Liberal papers, however, have not yet
discovered this fact, and, when politics are
dull, they demand that the revenues of
Chiltern shall be restored to the nation and
a University for working men built and
endowed with the same. This contention
helps to keep the memory of John Buss
green outside the walls of Chiltern, and
there are some who see in him a pioneer of
Democracy and a prophet of the University
Extension movement. Be that as it may,
Chiltern at the present moment is rich because
rich men are content to pay large fees in
order that their sons may have the privilege
of being educated, exclusively, with the
sons of other rich men. The junior masters
are of opinion that these large fees should be
made still larger, and the salaries of the junior
masters raised in proportion; but the senior
masters scout this proposal as mercenary.
The senior masters at Chiltern are popularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
supposed to be better paid than the senior
masters at any other school. Whether this is
so or not, it is impossible to say for certain;
for the senior masters at Chiltern only talk
of their salaries to the surveyor of taxes,
and, even then, they do so reluctantly.</p>

<p>The town of Chiltern lives to a great
extent upon the school, and the authorised
tradesmen, who enjoy a practical monopoly,
have a lively faith in the value of the goods
supplied by them to “the young gentlemen”;
which faith is convincingly reflected in the
prices they charge. In the unauthorised
trades, that is to say amongst tobacconists
and dealers in motor-cycles, air-guns, and
translations of the Classics, competition tends
to keep prices down. Nevertheless, these
illicit traders are always supposed to have
done remarkably well in the palmy days of
Dr. Gussy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this bond of union, there
is a traditional feeling of hostility on the part
of the town towards the school. This is due,
in part, to the fact that the school people
are supposed to look down upon the town
people, but, still more, to a widely prevalent
belief that, somehow or other, the school has
defrauded the town of the farrier’s benefactions.
As this belief is entirely without
foundation, it is likely to be lasting.</p>

<p>The country round Chiltern is pretty if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
not exciting. There is a round hill (called
by the masters “Soracte,” and by the natives
“the Sow’s Back”) at a convenient distance
from the school, which commands a view over
four counties and enables such of the staff as
are inclined to obesity to retain a semblance
of their youthful shape. In spring the landscape
is white with cherry and pear blossom,
and in autumn the apples make a cheerful
show. There are quiet lanes, peaceful farms,
and irritable farmers, who make unreasonable
complaints when “the young gentlemen”
break down their hedges, tread down their
young wheat, or pillage their orchards.</p>

<p>The climate is of the kind that is commonly
called salubrious; for anæmic boys it is
generally considered bracing, but it is also
recommended as temperate for those who are
afflicted with delicate chests. Like all schools
in England, public or private, Chiltern stands
on gravel, and the drains are of the most
approved and up-to-date pattern. Both the
gravel and the up-to-dateness of the drains
are vouched for by the school porter. The
school-rooms are for the most part dark,
but of great historic interest, and possessed of
an indefinable charm. This charm, and the
sense of continuity with a remote past, are
generally regarded as an adequate substitute
for ventilation. Indeed, many of the senior
masters at Chiltern are strongly opposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
ventilation in any form, and prefer their air
with a “bouquet.”</p>

<p>The playing fields, locally known as Colonus,
are amongst the noblest in England, and are
said to have been the scene of a sanguinary
battle between the Danes and the Saxons.
The School Antiquarian Society occasionally
indulges in feverish bouts of digging, in the
hope of unearthing bones or some other
memorial of the fray; but, hitherto, they
have failed to discover anything but stones
and the bowl of a clay pipe. A stream, which
flows at the far end of the grounds, provides
the school with a unique swimming-bath
(<i>vide</i> prospectus). Under Dr. Gussy’s
thoughtful régime the banks of this stream
were planted thickly with rhododendrons and
other flowering shrubs, which afford a reasonably
secure retreat, on Sundays, for such of
the scholars as wish to enjoy a quiet pipe
without the fatigue of pedestrian exercise.
But etiquette requires that boys who have
not yet reached their fourth Term shall
smoke elsewhere.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of its ancient school-rooms,
noble grounds, and salubrious climate,
Chiltern would probably never have become
one of <i>the</i> public schools of England if it had
not been for Dr. Lanchester. When Abraham
Lanchester became headmaster, at the end of
the eighteenth century, he found the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
little more than a county grammar school;
he left it an institution of National, almost
Imperial, importance.</p>

<p>Chiltern has lived ever since on the memory
of Dr. Lanchester. It is natural, therefore,
that he should be worshipped as the second
and greater founder of the community. John
Buss is honoured for his picturesque figure
and his priceless gift of antiquity, but Lanchester
is the presiding deity. His statue
stands in the centre of the great quadrangle,
his portrait looks down from the walls of
the Great Hall; the library, the workshops,
and other lesser buildings, or additions to
buildings, are called after his name; and
every foreign preacher in the School Chapel,
whether he is pleading for peace or war,
for Christian unity or Church defence, for
social service or Imperial expansion, closes
his peroration with an appeal to the memory
of Abraham Lanchester. The Lanchester
tradition permeates the place like an atmosphere,
invisible but stimulating. It is difficult
to analyse, for, like all great truths, it
states itself in different terms to different
minds and has a special message for each. To
the general public it stands for the Classics
and faith in the educational value of Latin
verse. To the masters it means a firm belief
in the efficacy of the methods, or absence of
method, to which they have become attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
through long habit. To the Old Chilternians
it embodies the social ideas and customs
with which they grew up; and to the boys
themselves, if it means anything more than
a name, it represents a certain immutability
and fixity of things, an as-it-was-in-the-beginning-is-now-and-ever-shall-be
attitude
towards life that appeals to their best conservative
instincts. Any change in the hour of a
lesson or the colour of a ribbon is regarded
as an outrage on the Lanchester tradition,
and is popularly supposed to make the dead
hero turn in his grave.</p>

<p>In connection with the school tradition
it should, perhaps, be mentioned that there
is a life of the great man by a friend and
contemporary, and that there is nothing in it
to suggest that Dr. Lanchester was so acutely
sensitive to change. He seems, indeed, to
have impressed his biographer as a restless
spirit, with new and rather daring ideas about
education. Bound in the school colours and
stamped with the school crest, this volume
is frequently given as a prize, and figures on
many a Chiltern bookshelf. But it is seldom
read, except by Germans and Nonconformist
ministers; for it is ponderously written, and
Chiltern is more concerned with the memory
than with the life of its great headmaster.
In fact, the tradition is an oral rather than
a written tradition, and it is perpetually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
renewed. Chiltern claims to receive a continuous
stream of inspiration from its second
founder; and the current of the stream runs
strongly against change.</p>

<p>But a moment came in the history of the
school, when the Lanchester tradition and all
that it stands for was threatened with a
violent overhauling, if not a complete extinction.
After a reign of four-and-twenty years,
to all outward appearance peaceful and prosperous,
Dr. Gussy suddenly discovered that he
had had enough of it and accepted a vacant
Deanery. And then the Governing Body, or
Council as it is properly called, in one of those
fits of absent-mindedness to which governing
bodies are liable, elected as his successor
a comparatively young man of unorthodox
views and no practical experience.</p>

<p>The election was one of the seven wonders
of the scholastic world. There had been
more than a score of candidates for the vacant
post, including a successful curate and an
unsuccessful army coach; but it was known
that only two of them were in the running,
Henry Guthridge and the Rev. Ignatius
Lawrence. Mr. Guthridge was a layman and
an Old Chilternian; he had served an
apprenticeship of five years as assistant
master at the school, and had since filled
the post of Hilbert Professor and Lecturer
at Oxford. Dr. Lawrence, a clergyman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of advanced Anglican views, hailed from
Cambridge, and had won a certain reputation
as headmaster of St. Cuthbert’s, in the north
of England. Mr. Guthridge was the official
candidate of the staff, and it was believed that
he would carry the day, in spite of the Bishop,
who was known to be strongly opposed to the
appointment of a layman. As for the Rev.
Septimus Flaggon, whose name, to everybody’s
surprise, was added as a third to the select
list, nobody treated his claims seriously.
Fellow of an obscure college, tutor to a foreign
prince, and subsequently president of some
educational institution in Wales, his youth
and inexperience ruled him out of serious
consideration. It transpired, moreover, that
he owed his place among the select to some
powerful influence in the background. Some
said that he was being run by a member of
the Royal family; others suspected the
Prime Minister; others, again, the Russian
Ambassador. But all agreed that he was,
where he was, <i>honoris causa</i> and as a matter of
form. The choice obviously lay between
Guthridge and Lawrence, with the odds in
favour of Guthridge, in spite of his laymanship.</p>

<p>However, when the Council met at Grandborough,
the county town, to come to a
decision, it was found that the Bishop had
canvassed strongly and that lay and clerical
forces were exactly evenly divided. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Chairman of the Council, a man of moderate
views, disliked clerical domination but was
also averse from the appointment of an Old
Chilternian; so he declined to give a casting
vote in favour of either candidate. Neither
side would budge an inch, and the contention
grew sharp between them. Twice Mr.
Guthridge and Dr. Lawrence were called
separately from the dingy room in which,
together with Mr. Flaggon, they were awaiting
their fate, and submitted to a lengthy cross-examination,
in the hope that one or other
of them would say something to turn the
evenly balanced scales. But neither succeeded
in detaching the necessary vote.</p>

<p>At length the Chairman, who had a train
to catch and a dinner depending on the train,
looked at his watch and hinted at an alternative
solution. Had the Council sufficiently
considered the claims of the third candidate,
a man of great promise with very influential
backing?</p>

<p>Compromise is an essential feature of the
English character, and long hours of enervating
discussion, in a stuffy room on a July afternoon,
are favourable to its rapid growth.
The Council was exhausted, and Mr. Flaggon
had some striking testimonials. His orders
were a sop to the Bishop, and his reputed
unorthodoxy appealed to the lay party. So,
at the eleventh hour, Mr. Flaggon was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
called into the Council Chamber. His
appearance was satisfactory, and his answers
to a few questions that were put to him by
the Chairman and the Bishop gave no offence.
He seemed a providential way out of an
impossible situation, and withdrew, at the
end of the interview, amidst encouraging
smiles. Five minutes later, to the chagrin
of his rivals and his own surprise, he was
invited once more into the Council Chamber
and informed that he was headmaster elect
of Chiltern. After which the Chairman left
hurriedly to catch his train.</p>

<p>At Chiltern the triumph of Guthridge was
awaited with quiet confidence. Nobody,
except Dr. Gussy, believed that the Council
would dare to disregard the explicit wishes of
the masters and the personal claims of the
only Old Chilternian who was standing—the
one man, in fact, who was qualified to carry
on, intact, the great Lanchester tradition.
So, when the astonishing news came through
that Flaggon, and not Guthridge, was the man,
it was received at first with blank incredulity,
followed immediately afterwards by a burst
of passionate resentment. Who was Flaggon,
what was Flaggon, who had ever heard or
dreamed of Flaggon? The masters were
seen talking and gesticulating in excited
groups in the great quadrangle.</p>

<p>“It’s an insult,” cried Mr. Pounderly, shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
his clenched fist, “a deliberate insult, aimed
at the whole staff. I say a deliberate insult!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Mr. Bent the cynic
(every staff possesses a cynic), “it’s merely
another instance of the ironic humour for
which the Council is famous.” Mr. Cox,
the Nestor of Chiltern, shook his head sadly
from side to side with a far-away look in his
eyes; Mr. Black, the senior mathematician,
was for petitioning the Council, at once, to
revoke its decision; and when Mr. Chase,
the moderate man (every staff possesses
at least one moderate who reads the <i>Spectator</i>),
expressed a timid hope that the newcomer
would be given a fair chance, he was within
an ace of being lynched. Even the school
porter, a man of solemn demeanour and grave
reticence, expressed the opinion that the
choice was “hominous.”</p>

<p>As for Dr. Gussy, who, without committing
himself publicly, had worked hard for Dr.
Lawrence in private, he was completely
prostrated by the blow. Scarcely could he
bring himself to make the official announcement
to the school in the Great Hall; and,
when he did so, it was with the voice and
gestures of the Roman prætor announcing
after Thrasymene, “We have lost a great
battle.” For several days he affected to
regard himself as superseded, set aside, and
sulked like Achilles in his tent.</p>

<small>MR. FLAGGON PAYS A VISIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> election of Mr. Flaggon was followed
immediately by the resignation of Mr. Cox.
Mr. Cox was in the habit of resigning whenever
his proposals were voted down or his
advice neglected. Dr. Gussy had, at various
times, received twelve such communications
from him and, on each occasion, had found
no difficulty in persuading Mr. Cox to reconsider
his decision. There is every reason
to suppose that Mr. Cox expected a similar
issue to his thirteenth act of protest. But
he had chosen his time badly. Dr. Gussy
merely said, “<i>I</i> no longer count,” and forwarded
the letter to the headmaster elect. And the
headmaster elect, unfamiliar with Mr. Cox’s
idiosyncrasies and much impressed by his
age, which was seventy-five, accepted the
resignation in a courteous and gracious spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox had so long regarded himself as
an integral and necessary part of Chiltern
and the Lanchester tradition that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
mortified to find how calmly his departure
was taken. His colleagues, indeed, were most
sympathetic, and said that his going would
be a terrible break with the past, and that
they would miss him increasingly. But they
added that they thought he had acted very
wisely in choosing this particular moment to
leave them; and this was not the sort of
consolation that Mr. Cox expected or desired.
It is said that he still regards himself as the
first and most notable victim of the new
régime, and speaks contemptuously of “poor
old Gussy, who couldn’t play a winning
hand even when he held all the trumps.”
How exactly the hand <i>should</i> have been
played is not clear; but the implication is
that Mr. Cox’s resignation was the ace of
trumps, and that, rightly used, it would
have brought the Council to its senses and
prevented untold calamities.</p>

<p>But, if Mr. Cox’s resignation was taken
calmly, Mr. Flaggon’s appointment continued
to stir Chiltern to its lowest depths. Articles
were disinterred from the back numbers of
magazines, educational or otherwise, in which
Mr. Flaggon had spoken slightingly of the
public schools and public school methods;
and the press was deplorable. The Liberal
dailies hailed the appointment as the beginning
of a new era and the death-blow to
an antiquated tradition. Even a leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Conservative journal, which should have
known better, described the election as a
daring but interesting experiment, and proceeded
to sketch an ideal curriculum, for
the benefit of the new headmaster, in which
Greek was abolished and its place taken
by compulsory military drill. The Council
blushed uneasily at finding itself suddenly in
the van of progress, and began to say harsh
things about its Chairman; and its Chairman
was only partially comforted by an assurance
from the distinguished person behind the
scenes that they had chosen the best man in,
“a man who will think before he acts and
who will go far.” For to the Chairman the
ideal headmaster was rather a man who
would mark time decorously than an explorer
of untrodden ways.</p>

<p>To the masters the suggestion that Chiltern
needed reforming—“turning inside out,” they
called it—was, to say the least, unpalatable.
As practical men they despised the theorist;
and, of all forms of theorist, the one that they
most disliked was the educational enthusiast—the
innovator, the impostor. Mr. Pounderly
went about with a scared face and mysterious
air, whispering “lamentable, lamentable” to
his colleagues; and Mr. Woburn, the scientist,
who affected metaphors and frequently mixed
them, declared that, though the Classics
were undoubtedly overdone at Chiltern, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
hated the idea of a man who would always
be trying experiments and pulling them up
by the roots to see how they were shaping.</p>

<p>The idea of petitioning the Council against
the appointment had been abandoned, partly
on the advice of the moderates, but chiefly
for lack of support from the juniors. For,
on second thoughts, the juniors discovered
that they did not want the new headmaster
to be a nominee and creature of the veterans.
The senior masters at Chiltern were famous
for their longevity and for the tenacious way
in which they clung to the posts of vantage;
and, if change meant only a gradual shifting
of the senior masters, there was something
to be said in favour of change. But it was
clearly understood that, if Mr. Flaggon
attempted to drive his staff along new and
unfamiliar ways, he would find them a most
awkward and intractable team to handle.</p>

<p>Amid the babel of tongues there was one
man who maintained what was, for him,
an attitude of unusual reserve. This was
Mr. Chowdler, the strong man of Chiltern.
Mr. Chowdler owed his reputation for strength,
not to any breadth of view or depth of
sympathetic insight, but to a sublime
unconsciousness of his own limitations.
Narrow but concentrated, with an aggressive
will and a brusque intolerance of all who
differed from him, he was a fighter who loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
fighting for its own sake and who triumphed
through the sheer exhaustion of his enemies;
and a Term in which he did not engage in at
least one mortal combat was to him a blank
Term. A tall man, with broad shoulders,
round head, thin sandy hair, and full lips,
he caught the eye in whatever company he
might be, and his resonant voice arrested
attention. At golfing centres, in the holidays,
he was not always a very popular figure.
But his confident manner impressed parents,
and his was considered <i>the</i> house at Chiltern.
People often wondered why he had never
stood for headmasterships or sought a wider
scope for the exercise of power. In reality
he had never felt the need. He had so
completely identified himself with Chiltern
that it never even occurred to him to leave it;
and his had for many years been the master
mind that shaped the destinies of the school.</p>

<p>In saying this we are not forgetting the
existence of Dr. Gussy. But Dr. Gussy,
though he had been the titular chief for
nearly a quarter of a century, had long ceased
to be the ruling spirit. In vulgar phrase,
he had allowed Mr. Chowdler to “run him,”
and it was generally supposed to be weariness
of bondage rather than of power which had
induced him to resign before the completion of
his twenty-fifth year of office. In appearance
he was a complete contrast to his formidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
lieutenant. Small and rather fragile, with
silver-white hair and a refined, delicately
moulded face that suggested Dresden china,
he was the type of the old-fashioned
scholar. Though there was nothing commanding
in his personality it was none the less
distinguished, and the thinness of a high-pitched,
and sometimes almost squeaky, voice
was atoned for by the perfection of his articulation.
In his younger days he had taken
a prominent place among the champions of
the Oxford Movement, and, if he had not
become a headmaster, he might have been
notorious as a theologian; indeed, his commentary
on the Epistle of St. Clement is
admitted by all to be a remarkable work.
Fathers of Chiltern boys loved to hear him
read the lessons, and mothers frequently
remarked, “What a lovely face!” But he
was by nature too refined and sensitive
to cope successfully with the robust methods
of Mr. Chowdler, and, after struggling fitfully
for some years, he had purchased comparative
peace by an irritable submission. Mrs.
Chowdler, an obtuse little woman who worshipped
her husband and imagined that
everybody at Chiltern shared her admiration,
used to say that “Harry” was the
headmaster’s better self. She had herself
always been ready and willing to be a sister
to Mrs. Gussy; but after a long series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
pointed rebuffs she had abandoned the attempt,
and the relations between the two families
were official rather than cordial.</p>

<p>It was not likely that Mr. Chowdler
would approve of the new appointment;
indeed, he seldom approved of any arrangement
that was not of his own making. But
his attitude was one of amused banter rather
than of fierce hostility, and he spoke with a
good-natured smile of the “Empty Flaggon.”
“Wait and see” was his advice. “You will
find that the place and its traditions are too
strong for the empty one. He may froth
and he may fume, but he can’t hurt us. We
are strong enough to assimilate a whole
cellarful of Flaggons.”</p>

<p>These and similar remarks made it clear
to the initiated that Mr. Chowdler proposed
to run the new headmaster, as he had run
his predecessor.</p>

<p>In the middle of July Mr. Flaggon paid
his first visit to Chiltern. The position of
a headmaster elect is a delicate one, and he
wisely declined to be introduced formally
to the school. If omens count for anything,
the circumstances of this visit were inauspicious;
for it coincided with a period
of four-and-twenty hours of continuous rain.
Mr. Flaggon carried away a general impression
of gloom and dripping umbrellas; but one
incident, trivial in itself, left a permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
record on his memory. During one of the
brief pauses in the downpour, he was walking
with Dr. Gussy across Colonus towards the
Lanchester workshops, and, on the way,
met three of the bigger boys who were
sauntering slowly in the opposite direction.
There was something about their gait and
manner which, if not exactly insolent, at
least suggested a complete absence of anything
like awe in the presence of their headmaster.
They gave a perfunctory salute; and, before
they passed out of earshot, a voice, which
made no attempt to lower itself, remarked:</p>

<p>“Is that the new Gus?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” replied a second voice,
in the same devil-take-me-if-<i>I</i>-care tone,
“unless it’s his shuvver.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon, who with the principles of
a democrat combined all the instincts of a
despot, lifted his eyebrows in surprise and
his fingers tightened unconsciously round the
handle of his umbrella. But Dr. Gussy
appeared to be quite unconcerned and made
no comment.</p>

<p>Under the depressing climatic conditions
the hours passed rather slowly. Dr. Gussy
was courtesy itself, but he found it impossible
to be cordial or communicative to a man who
was the last person he would have chosen as
his successor; and Mr. Flaggon felt it a relief
when Mrs. Gussy carried him off to inspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the house and talk fixtures. Dr. Gussy had
wisely left all the business arrangements in
the hands of his wife, a capable woman with
all the capable woman’s contempt for the
supposed ignorance of a young man and a
bachelor; and it soon became evident that
Mrs. Gussy intended to take full advantage
of her superior knowledge. With a happy
mixture of adroitness and authority she
forced upon the incoming tenant the oldest
carpets and the least successful bits of furniture;
and, with equal skill, she secured a
tacit permission to carry off some of the
more desirable fixtures.</p>

<p>“We are taking the tiles with us to the
Deanery,” she would say, pointing to a fireplace;
“but, of course, we shall leave you the
linoleum and that very useful deal cupboard.
They were both made for the room.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon had no desire to haggle,
but he had the Northerner’s dislike of being
done; and, before the round was over,
he found himself in revolt. Mrs. Gussy
described him afterwards as “close”; and
Mr. Flaggon, in relating his experiences to his
mother, said that if Mrs. Gussy had been a
little less autocratic, she would have made
an excellent saleswoman. The youngest Miss
Gussy, a girl of seventeen and the only other
member of the family who was at home,
did not put in an appearance. She could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
bring herself to shake hands with the supplanter
of her father, the “horrid man”
who was going to live in <i>their</i> house and enjoy
<i>their</i> garden. If Mr. Flaggon had been an
angel from Heaven, she would have hated
him with equal fervour. So she withdrew
for the day to the Pounderlys’ and contented
herself with a glimpse of “the man” from
a window; which glimpse confirmed her in
her worst forebodings. Mrs. Chowdler, who
had a talent for saying the wrong thing,
remarked that it would be “a very happy
coincidence” if Mr. Flaggon and Miss Gussy
took a fancy to each other, as it would give
a continuity to life at Chiltern and make the
impending change “so much less felt.” With
the object of promoting such a match she
spoke warmly to the youngest Miss Gussy
of the new headmaster’s personal appearance,
and was dismayed at the violent outburst
which her eulogy provoked.</p>

<p>In the evening, after dinner, Mr. Chowdler
called by arrangement and carried off his
new chief, nominally to introduce him over
a quiet pipe to a few colleagues, but really
to take his measure and begin the training
of which he was supposed to be in need.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon did not smoke, neither did
he drink; but he was placed in the easiest
of the study chairs, next to the fireplace,
and the colleagues lit their pipes and arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
themselves in a semicircle round the empty
grate. There is always something singularly
dispiriting about an empty grate on a wet
summer evening, and a semicircular formation
round it emphasises its forlornness. The
colleagues were conscious of a feeling of
constraint. After all that they had been
saying and thinking about him in the past
week, they were shy of being over-cordial
to their new chief, and some of them felt a
little as if they were taking part in a conspiracy,
engineered by Chowdler, to exploit
the inexperience of the new man.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon, for his part, did not possess
the easy manner and command of small
talk which put strangers at their ease.
Though anxious to be friendly, he was by
nature reticent, one of those who, in new
surroundings, are more disposed to receive
impressions than to create them. So, after
a little desultory talk about the golf links,
and several ineffective openings that led
into blind alleys, the conversation suddenly
expired, and the colleagues found themselves
gazing desperately at three iron bars and some
unhealthy-looking green and yellow paper
behind them.</p>

<p>This was the psychological moment for
Mr. Chowdler. Hitherto he had been busy
pouring out whisky-and-sodas and struggling
with a refractory pipe; but he now sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
down opposite the guest of the evening and
opened the main attack.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he began, “that you have
been hearing a good deal to-day about our
great headmaster Dr. Lanchester. Have you
ever studied his life?”</p>

<p>“I have indeed,” replied Mr. Flaggon;
“in fact, it was one of the first books that
excited my interest in public school education.
It might, no doubt, have been better written;
but it is, in its way, I think, one of the most
suggestive books in the English language.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad to hear you say that!”
cried Mr. Chowdler. “I’m so glad to hear
you say that; because you know, we cling
very, <i>very</i> faithfully here to our past and our
great Conservative tradition.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you forgetting,” said Mr. Flaggon
quickly, “that Dr. Lanchester was always
considered a Radical?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler <i>had</i> forgotten; all Chiltern
was in the habit of forgetting this unpleasant
fact. But he would not own to any lapse
of memory, and his voice took on a note
of challenge as he replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, a name doesn’t frighten <i>me</i>; there’s
nothing in a name; names are only the
coinage of the foolish. Lanchester was a
man of very Conservative instincts. He was
not one of those who love change for change’s
sake. He was a restorer, not a destroyer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“It must be difficult to be the one without
the other,” remarked Mr. Flaggon quietly;
“and I have always heard that Dr. Lanchester
was both.”</p>

<p>Antipathies are often physical as well
as moral, and the two men suddenly became
conscious of a kind of physical distaste for
one another. In Chowdler’s fleshy limbs,
broad shoulders, bullet head, and aggressive
manner, Mr. Flaggon saw for the moment the
personification of that narrow but confident
prejudice which blocks progress and strangles
reform; while Mr. Chowdler realised acutely
that “the man Flaggon” would easily get
on his nerves. There was an awkward pause
which Mr. Beadle filled by remarking:</p>

<p>“You must have found it very interesting
work tutoring a foreign prince.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Chowdler, though momentarily
disconcerted, was not to be diverted from
his main purpose; and, before Mr. Flaggon
could frame a reply, he interposed again
with:</p>

<p>“Talking of princes reminds me of something
that happened to me a little while ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler had a large stock of anecdotes
with which his colleagues were painfully
familiar, for he was never afraid of repeating
himself. In theory Mr. Chowdler scorned
sentimentality and even sentiment, but in
practice his stories were nearly all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
sentimental order and related how small
boys had looked up at him wistfully, or
old boys had grasped his hand with manly
tears in their eyes. And both wistful small
boys and manly old boys had nearly always
contrived to say something illuminating about
the Lanchester tradition.</p>

<p>When once Mr. Chowdler was started,
he passed from one story to another without
a halt. Mr. Flaggon was conscious that
the anecdotes were being related not <i>to</i> him
but <i>at</i> him. However, he smiled when a
smile seemed to be expected, and looked
impressed where it was obviously the right
thing to look impressed. But, when his
host concluded the fifteenth story with the
remark, “And I think it’s such a splendid
idea that the old traditions are being planted,
with the old flag, far away over the water,
in Saskatchewan,” he could not help saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be better,
perhaps, if the Colonies were allowed to
create their own traditions and their own
ideals? If there is to be development, there
must be new forms; and I always hope
that the colonies will have something new
to teach <i>us</i> some day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler did not agree, and he said
so in words which produced another awkward
pause; and Mr. Beadle once more came to
the rescue by remarking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I suppose that they are very keen about
education in Wales?” Which showed that
Mr. Beadle had been making a study of the
new headmaster’s previous history.</p>

<p>When the marble clock on the mantelpiece
pointed to eleven, Mr. Flaggon rose to go.
A day with Dr. Gussy, and an evening spent
in the company of Mr. Chowdler, had induced
an unusual feeling of weariness. He and
his host shook hands at parting with every
outward appearance of friendliness; but, as
he walked home under the dripping trees to
the Prætorium, as Dr. Gussy’s house was
called, he was conscious that, amongst the
many problems that he would have to
face at Chiltern, Mr. Chowdler would almost
certainly be one of the most difficult.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>EXIT DR. GUSSY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last fortnight of the Term was largely
devoted to saying good-bye to Dr. Gussy.
It was traditional at Chiltern for a headmaster
to be received with curses and dismissed
with blessings; and an unwritten law required
that, as his last Term drew to a close, words
of ill-omen should become few and fewer.
During the last fortnight, even Mr. Chowdler
gave up speaking of “silly old Fussy” and
substituted “poor old Gussy,” or, more rarely,
“<i>dear</i> old Gussy.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gussy had never identified himself
very closely with the life of the school, nor
allowed himself to become absorbed in its
daily happenings; his youngest daughter
probably knew far more about the inner
life of Chiltern than he did, and could address
by their nicknames boys of whom her father
had some difficulty in recalling the surname.
Outside interests had taken him frequently
from Chiltern, and the branch line (like all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
branch lines) made it easier to leave Chiltern
than to get back to it. He had often missed
important matches, his place had frequently
been empty at Sunday chapels, and he had
been known to confuse the identity of important
people. A current story, of which
there were many variations, made him address
the senior fag of Mr. Cox’s house as the
junior master on the staff. But his rule
was mild and his nature unsuspicious; so
he had always enjoyed a fair measure of
popularity, and, during his last fortnight,
he was positively worshipped.</p>

<p>Dr. Gussy himself was quite unconscious
of any sins of omission. He was fond of
boasting that Chiltern was a school that
“ran itself”; and, as a proof of its good
discipline and high moral tone, he would
say, proudly, “For the last seven years I
haven’t had to expel a single boy—not a
single boy.”</p>

<p>This record greatly impressed anxious
parents, and had attracted to the school
several sons of the titled plutocracy, whose
sensitive natures required considerate and
tactful handling rather than the rough and
ready methods in vogue elsewhere. Dr. Gussy
was proud of the distinguished names that
figured on his school lists, and never had
Chiltern been more popular or more prosperous
than during the last seven years of his reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Needless to say, the Doctor received an
incredible number of presents. It was like
a second wedding. Each division of the
school gave its separate gift, and, at the
earnest request of Mrs. Gussy, who valued
spontaneity above all things, the boys were
left to make their own choice without
prompting from their elders. The Lower
School gave a Tantalus, big enough to blast
the reputation of the most saintly Dean;
the Removes, a telescope of immense power,
because, in Dr. Gussy’s sermons, there were
frequent allusions to the stars; the Fifths,
an invalid’s chair of elaborate mechanical
cunning, and the Prefects a complete set
of engravings of Chiltern from its earliest
days, of which Dr. Gussy already had
duplicates in a portifollo. Only the Old
Boys, instead of giving anything to Dr.
Gussy personally, presented his picture to
the library (none might hang in the Great
Hall save Dr. Lanchester only), and, by a
happy thought, entrusted the painting of
it to an Old Chilternian whom Nature had
intended for a caricaturist, but who had
elected to win fame as a portrait-painter.</p>

<p>And to each division separately Dr. Gussy
made one of the felicitous little speeches
for which he was famous. To the Lower
School he said that, whenever he saw that
splendid Tantalus on his sideboard, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
should give it the place of honour on his
sideboard (those who knew Mrs. Gussy best
thought otherwise), he should remember the
kind thought of the givers and be with them
again in the spirit. (Cheers, but no laughter,
the Lower School being in too solemn a mood
to anticipate a jest.) To the Removes he
said that he would now be able, from his
peaceful Deanery, to watch the Removes,
through his telescope, studying their lessons
with the zeal and enthusiasm for which they
had always been famous. (Laughter and
applause.) To the Fifths he said that, whenever
he reclined in that luxurious chair—and
he hoped that he would have time
and leisure at last to recline, occasionally, in
an easy-chair (suppressed amusement)—he
should always think of the happy, strenuous
days which he had lived amongst them and
for them; for they had always been, and
always would be, very near to his heart.
(Emotion, and a murmur at the back of
“Good old Gussy.”) To the Prefects he said
that, whenever he looked at those beautiful
and interesting prints—and he should look
at them daily, for they would be hanging
on his walls (cheers)—he would see the
dear old place repeopled again with the
faces that he had now before him, and take
courage in the thought of the simple, manly,
unostentatious, but whole-hearted devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
to duty which had always been characteristic
of the Prefects at Chiltern, and which
had given its high moral tone to the
school that they loved so well. (Prolonged
sensation.)</p>

<p>But it is unnecessary to quote further.
It is enough to say that there was a general
atmosphere of mutual good-will and esteem,
in which impositions were daily remitted
(except by Mr. Black, who lacked imagination),
and everybody felt that he was an integral
part of a great institution, bound by ties
of personal devotion to the headmaster,
and doing yeoman’s work.</p>

<p>One of the most successful functions of
this epoch was the farewell dinner, given by
the junior masters in Common Room to their
chief. Though the masters at Chiltern lived
in lodgings or in private houses of their own,
it was part of the Lanchester tradition that the
bachelors amongst them should dine together
once a week in Common Room. A spinster
lady, distantly connected with the school,
had bequeathed funds for this purpose; and,
though the cooking was not recherché nor the
conversation of much general interest, the
weekly dinner was valued as a picturesque
ceremony in keeping with the atmosphere of
the place, and was hedged in with a rigorous
etiquette. Thus, when any member of the
community succumbed to matrimony, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
expelled with a quaint and time-honoured
ritual. Some awkwardness had arisen when
Mr. Flyte, after being formally “inhibited”
from “bread, beef, and trencher,” was thrown
over by his fiancée at the eleventh hour;
for the inhibition had always been regarded
as final and irrevocable, and there was no
precedent to serve as a guide. Mr. Flyte,
however, solved the difficulty with great
tact, by never applying for readmission
as a bachelor and allowing himself to be
reckoned, for dining purposes, as an honorary
widower.</p>

<p>But, though the etiquette was formal and
the Common Room dinner sacred to bachelors,
it was decided, unanimously, that a point
might be stretched in favour of a departing
chief. Dr. Gussy was invited, and Dr. Gussy
accepted.</p>

<p>The preparations were on an unusual scale
and were in the hands of Mr. Rankin, who
was good at that kind of thing and proud of
his <i>savoir faire</i>. An ice-pudding was ordered
from Smith’s, the school confectioner; the
library attendant and the under ground-man,
who waited, were put into dress clothes for
the occasion; and Mr. Grady’s sister kindly
arranged the flowers. Mr. Chase, the senior
member and president, provided a special
brand of champagne from his private cellars,
and there were three savouries and no less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
six liqueurs. Dr. Gussy was placed at the head
of the table, with Mr. Chase on his right and the
newest appointment to the school on his left.
Dr. Gussy was but little known personally to
the younger members of his staff, and his
conduct had not always escaped criticism;
for, when he had been suffering much at the
hands of Mr. Chowdler, he was in the habit,
to use a vulgar phrase, of “taking it out of”
the juniors whom he did not fear. But, on
this occasion, he was not only courteous but
anecdotal and intimate. For the first time,
Dr. Gussy and his junior masters discovered
each other; and the discovery only added to
the pain of separation. The party broke up
at a late hour and everybody went home murmuring
“dear old Gussy”; except, of course,
dear old Gussy himself, who had been plied
generously with the ice-pudding and the six
liqueurs, and who, after a restless night,
woke up next morning with something of
a liver.</p>

<p>On the last night but two of Term there
was another and a more questionable display
of feeling. At the witching hour of eleven
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a considerable portion of the school
(estimates of the exact numbers varied) picturesquely
clad in bed-clothes and pyjamas,
and armed with sackbuts, psalteries, dulcimers
and all kinds of music, appeared suddenly on
the headmaster’s front lawn and proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to serenade their chief with a topical song, of
which the chorus ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Young sir, do not answer at random,</div>
<div class="verse">No boy should be seen on a tandem.”</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, whatever we think of the Badger or Mink,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
<div class="verse">De Gussibus non disputandum.</div>
</div></div>

<p>A remnant of sanity kept the headmaster
from appearing in person, but his wife and the
youngest Miss Gussy, who were not insensible
to such attentions, showed themselves at
the open windows of the drawing-room and
were acclaimed uproariously—especially the
youngest Miss Gussy.</p>

<p>It was felt, however, amongst the staff,
that things were going a little farther than
was wise. Loyalty is all very well, but
loyalty should be tempered by discretion;
and the housemasters came in for some
criticism on account of their supposed connivance.
Even Mr. Plummer, the most
confirmed of optimists, had misgivings, and
observed next day in Common Room:</p>

<p>“It really does look as if some of the
housemasters had been a little slack; unless,
of course, the whole thing has been very much
exaggerated.”</p>

<p>“It has, as you say,” replied Mr. Bent,
“been very much exaggerated. There were,
in reality, no boys, no music, no song, no Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Gussy. The whole thing was a phantasm
of the living, an allegory, an unsubstantial
pageant that fades and leaves not a wrack
behind. I know it for a fact.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Plummer.</p>

<p>“I have questioned each of the housemasters
separately,” replied Mr. Bent, “and
each has assured me, in tones of the
deepest conviction, that his own Prefects
can be trusted absolutely, and that it is,
moreover, physically and structurally impossible
for any boy to leave that particular
house after dark without the knowledge of
his housemaster. Each has further informed
me that, if only the other housemasters would
take the same simple and common-sense
precautions, such scenes as the one we are
deploring to-day would be impossible. Now,
what do you say to that, Plummer? You
are surely not such a cynic as to doubt the
word of a housemaster?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler treated the matter in a more
serious spirit. He had watched the unexpected
apotheosis of Dr. Gussy without
enthusiasm—“sentiment run mad” he called
it—and the official countenance given to the
serenade by Mrs. and Miss Gussy filled him
with indignation. He felt that it was high
time for somebody to speak to the “silly old
man.” When duty called, Mr. Chowdler was
not the man to shirk an unpleasant task, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his sense of duty was sharpened by a strong
personal dislike of Mrs. and the youngest Miss
Gussy. He therefore appeared in the headmaster’s
study after lunch, wearing the
particular expression which Dr. Gussy had
learned to associate with some of the unpleasanter
moments of his own life.</p>

<p>Now, Dr. Gussy had been as much surprised
as anybody at the sudden blaze of popularity
of which he had been the centre; but, being
naïve and not addicted to self-analysis, he had
thoroughly enjoyed it. Moreover, the days
of his bondage were almost accomplished,
and he no longer felt afraid of any man. So
he did what he had not done for many a long
day, namely, snapped his fingers in Mr.
Chowdler’s face, and even told him not to
be an old woman—at least, so Mrs. Gussy
told her friends, and a Dean’s wife must be
supposed to speak the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler gave a somewhat different
version of the encounter, in which the honours
were made to rest with himself rather than
with his chief. But even he could not conceal
the fact that he had received a diplomatic
rebuff. He relieved his feelings by calling
together his house Prefects and giving them
one of his straight manly talks. “Things,”
he said, “are shaky—you would probably call
them ‘dicky’; but I shall call them shaky—and
with anxious times ahead of us next Term, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
can’t afford to be playing ducks and drakes
with our best traditions; and, what with
weakness at the top and giddy heads at the
bottom, that’s just what some folks are
beginning to do. You know what I am
referring to—that ridiculous scene last night.
I know what you think about it. You and
I understand each other, and we know where
the blame lies. We needn’t dot the i’s, but
there are certain houses, not a hundred miles
from here, which would be better for a taste
of our friend Archie’s strong arm.” Here “our
friend Archie,” who was head of the eleven,
fidgeted uncomfortably. “Now, I want you
to remember,” continued Mr. Chowdler impressively,
“that your influence ought not to
end with the house. I want you to talk sense
to giddy heads and to strengthen feeble knees.
I want you to set your candles on a hill
where the whole school can see them. I want
you, when everybody else is failing, to be
the pillars and the props of our grand old
Lanchester tradition.”</p>

<p>The Prefects in Mr. Chowdler’s house
were genuinely afraid of Mr. Chowdler, though
they had long learnt how to manage him.
They now looked portentously solemn, confessed
that they <i>had</i> heard rumours of the
impending “rag” beforehand, but had not
taken them seriously, and admitted that
Mr. Cox’s house was not as good as it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
once been. But they were much too tactful
and considerate to let out that, as holders
of the cricket trophy, they had themselves
headed the procession in a body.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that people were
just a little anxious as to what might happen
at the school concert on the last night of
Term. Even Dr. Gussy confessed privately
that he would be glad when the concert
was over. For a great many Old Chilternians
were expected for the occasion, and, when
Old Boys get together and become excited,
they are sometimes—not rowdy, of course,
but, perhaps, a little boisterous; and then
the school catches the excitement and loses
its sense of proportion. Still, the boys at
Chiltern were all gentlemen; and, if you
treat gentlemen <i>as</i> gentlemen, they may be
trusted to behave as gentlemen. Everybody
at Chiltern believed that, except, perhaps, Mr.
Bent, who was a cynic and believed nothing,
and Mr. Grady, the science master, whose
face always had a hunted expression and who
sometimes came out of school with mice
in his pockets and his hair full of flour.</p>

<p>However, in spite of forebodings, the concert
was not much more noisy than concerts
usually were at Chiltern. Dr. Gussy was
cheered to the echo, and, though he had taken
his official farewell of the school only half
an hour before, he was obliged to come on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
to the platform and make another speech.
Mrs. Gussy smiled her acknowledgments
from her place, and the youngest Miss Gussy
was in tears. As for the school song, it
went with a roar that nearly lifted the roof
off the Great Hall. The song of Chiltern
is not essentially different from other school
songs. Without ever lapsing into poetry, it
maintains, throughout, a fair rhythm and
a high level of imbecility. Its opening verse
has served as a model to many imitations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">John Buss was a farrier bold,</div>
<div class="indent2">And he turned his sweat into drops of gold;</div>
<div class="indent2">He fought hard battles, and when he died</div>
<div class="indent2">He left a school for his country’s pride,</div>
<div class="indent2">The best of schools, that has won renown</div>
<div class="indent2">From Chiltern chimes to the frontier town.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Chorus</i>: John Buss, John of Us,</div>
<div class="indent4">Played good cricket and made no fuss.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To realise the full possibilities of the song,
you must go to Chiltern and hear it sung:
especially the chorus, where, after the trebles
have piped “John Buss,” the whole school
joins in with “John of Us.” The effect is
electrical and intensely moving.</p>

<p>When the concert was over, the Old
Chilternians played a game of football in
Colonus by moonlight, and afterwards paraded
the town, arm in arm, singing school songs.
There were more than a hundred of them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
they sang in different keys; so that the townspeople
did not have a very tranquil night.</p>

<p>And in the second week of the holidays,
when everybody had gone away and the
whole place was in confusion, Mr. Flaggon
came down unexpectedly and insisted on
making a more detailed inspection of the
school than had been possible during his first
visit; much to the annoyance of the porter,
whose mind was not as clear on that day
as he could have wished, though his face
was more solemn than ever. Amongst the
buildings visited was Mr. Cox’s old house,
which was undergoing extensive repairs for
its new proprietor, Mr. Chase; and there,
on certain walls, Mr. Flaggon found writing
which, though he did not fully understand
it, made him glad that he had accepted Mr.
Cox’s resignation.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE FIRST SKIRMISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Flaggon</span> had come to Chiltern with a
determination to do great things for education.
He himself had had a hard struggle to win
to knowledge, and the phases of the struggle
had left their mark deeply imprinted on his
character. Born with a thirst for knowledge,
he had had to force his way, step by step,
to the fountain head; and the narrow circumstances
of a Cumberland vicarage had strewn
the path with difficulties. Old and musty
books spelled out by candlelight in his father’s
study, then a scholarship at a decaying
provincial grammar school, and finally a
classical exhibition at a small Oxford College—such
had been the stages by which he had
made his way up the stream. And, when
he reviewed the past, he could not but
remember how brackish and unsatisfying
the water had often been in the channels
where he had been compelled to seek it. If
his thirst had been less insatiable, his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
experiences might well have cured him of
the desire to drink.</p>

<p>To a childhood spent among the Cumbrian
Fells he owed a robust constitution and a
toughness of fibre that defied fatigue; perhaps,
too, a certain gravity and reticence which
seem to come naturally to those who are
bred among mountains. Rather below middle
height, with a clear-cut face and an intellectual
forehead, his most striking feature was his
eyes—fearless, grey, receptive eyes, which
looked out upon the world with a quiet
but penetrating interest. A friend, who knew
him intimately, described them as seeing,
rather than speaking, eyes.</p>

<p>Of public schools he knew nothing from
the inside, and he had few opportunities
of studying public school men at his own
small college. In such as he came across
he had noted a certain self-sufficiency and
polite lack of interest in things intellectual,
which he put down to the narrowness of
their training. The circumstances of his own
upbringing had thrown him almost entirely
among boys and men who had to make their
own way in the world, and who were desperately
intent on turning even half a talent
to profitable use. Their aims might be low
and their ambitions sordid, but there was
no trifling with opportunity, no deliberate
rejection of golden chances. He had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
no practical experience of that large and
wealthy class of people who have been well
off for two generations and whose children are
born with an assured future—the people,
in fact, who send their boys to the richer
public schools; and he had yet to learn
how paralysing to the intellectual life an
assured future may be. In a word, he did
not yet understand the psychology of the
horse who refuses to drink when taken to the
water; and, noticing that public school men
were, as a class, unintellectual, he assumed
that their minds had been starved, and that
their teachers set no store by intellect.</p>

<p>The idea of standing for a headmastership
had first been suggested to him by an acquaintance
whom chance had thrown in his way.
After securing his Fellowship, Mr. Flaggon had
accepted a post as tutor to a foreign prince,
partly because the work was light and he
needed a holiday, and partly because the
tutorship was a travelling one and he was
eager to see something of the world. Ten
days of continuous rain and snow on the
Riffel Alp had thrown him much into the
society of the great man behind the scenes
to whom allusion has already been made.
The great man was both an enthusiast for
education and a firm believer in ability; he
even had the hardihood to maintain that
ability is of greater value than experience, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
experiment more fruitful of results than the
accepted method of playing for safety. Being
a shrewd judge of men, he soon discerned,
beneath the tutor’s quiet and unsensational
exterior, signs of exceptional power; and he
did not lose sight of him. The Welsh appointment
was largely his doing, and, when the
headmastership of Chiltern fell vacant, it
was he who wrote and suggested that Mr.
Flaggon should stand.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon himself had hardly regarded
his candidature even as a forlorn hope. It
was intended rather as a <i>ballon d’essai</i>, a
notice to the scholastic world that he considered
himself a possible headmaster, and an
opportunity of gauging how that world would
regard his claims. Chiltern, as we have seen,
had no hesitation in branding his pretensions
as presumptuous; and Mr. Flaggon was
quite aware that the success of his audacious
move, which had come as a surprise to himself,
had been more than a disappointment to his
future colleagues.</p>

<p>But he was not dismayed by the difficulty
of the task that lay before him. His whole
life had been spent in overcoming difficulties,
and he had the quiet confidence of a man who
is sure of his own temper and accustomed to
succeed. As has been stated before, he
brought with him to his new work a great zeal
for the cause of education; but he had no cut-and-dried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
theories of reform, no patent nostrum
of his own. He knew what education <i>ought</i>
to be, what it had been to himself—an individual
renaissance, a quickening of the highest
faculties of mind and spirit; and he knew
that that was precisely what public school
education was <i>not</i>. He was determined to
study the problem on the spot and to proceed
tentatively. The machinery, as he saw it,
was antiquated, the bill of fare obsolete, the
valley full of dry bones. But the dry bones
were only waiting for a revivifying spirit to
become clothed with flesh and to start into
life again. In his mind’s eye he saw the boys
as hungry sheep who looked up and were not
fed. He had not yet become acquainted
with that particular breed of sheep that is
born without an appetite.</p>

<p>But ever since his first flying visit to the
school, Mr. Flaggon had begun to realise that
there were other problems behind the educational
one which would claim the attention
of a headmaster. He had always taken on
trust the virtues that are considered inherent
in the public school system—loyalty,
discipline, gentlemanly behaviour, and a
subordination of the individual will to the
interests of the community. In his undergraduate
days he had often experienced an
absurd sensation of being considered morally,
as well as socially, inferior to the more fortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
alumni of the great public schools. Old Boys
had talked to him with flashing eyes and
genuine conviction of the exceptional merits
of their own schools, and of the enhanced
value which they gave to life; and he had
believed them. And what he believed of
other schools he had been taught to believe
as pre-eminently true of Chiltern. Chiltern
was the only institution of its kind about
which nobody had as yet written a schoolboy
story; but it ranked amongst the aristocracy
of public schools, and, in the eyes of Chilternians,
even higher. And it had special characteristics
of its own. Somebody had said that
Chiltern turned out gentlemen rather than
scholars; and somebody else, probably an
Old Chilternian, had added that you could
always tell a Chiltern boy from the way he
behaved in a drawing-room. Wealthy manufacturers
sent their sons to Chiltern to acquire
the easy manners and social polish which
seemed natural to the place; and to be an
Old Chilternian was an “open sesame” to
any club that was not primarily intellectual.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon had expected, therefore, to
find a somewhat low level of mental attainments
but a high standard of good breeding.
But, ever since his first visit, his mind had
been haunted by the picture of three vapid
youths strolling past their headmaster with
insolent unconcern and the blasé voices saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Is that the new Gus?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it—unless it’s his shuvver.”</p>

<p>And then there was the writing on certain
walls in Mr. Cox’s house.</p>

<p>This unfavourable impression was confirmed
as he watched the boys in Chapel on
the first Sunday of the Term. There was an
air of insolence and swagger about the way
in which the bigger boys strolled in last and
lounged, instead of kneeling, during the
prayers. Signs of intelligence were frequent
between block and block; and, even among
the smaller boys, there was often a kind of
self-consciousness and pose, which, though
he could not quite analyse the cause, affected
Mr. Flaggon unpleasantly. He had often heard
of the impressiveness of a school-chapel
service. There was certainly nothing impressive
about the service at Chiltern on the
first Sunday of the Term, except, perhaps, the
singing of the hymns—and that was much
more noisy than reverent.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon belonged to no definite party
in the Church. A dislike of labels and definitions,
coupled with a strong desire to make
the Church inclusive rather than exclusive,
had won him the easy hatred of the dogmatists
and the reputation of being unorthodox.
His own religious views had been deeply
coloured by the life and example of his father,
a man of great but unrecognised power, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
had cheerfully sacrificed all personal ambition
to work in an obscure Cumbrian parish. At
one period of his youth, his father’s attitude
to life and cheerful acceptance of a lot so far
below his merits, had puzzled him; and he
had allowed himself to wonder whether such
complete self-abnegation was commendable
or even right. But the extraordinary manifestations
of grief which that father’s death
provoked in the whole neighbourhood had
taught him to judge the value of work by a
different standard, and to realise that the
things of the spirit can never be adequately
measured in terms of the flesh. Henceforward,
the life of duty, and faith in the individual
conscience, which had been the secret
of the father’s influence, became the ideals of
the son, and, if he was attracted into the field
of education, it was largely because, to him,
education in its truest sense meant a lifting of
the veil from the spirit. But as he mounted
the Chiltern pulpit to deliver his first sermon
from the text “The letter killeth, but the
spirit maketh alive,” he felt conscious, instinctively
and with something of a chill, that
the note he was going to sound was not a note
that would find an echo in the hearts of his congregation.
Here were no hungry sheep looking
up to be fed, but indifference, inertia, and an
unknown something that was probably worse
than either and possibly the cause of both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Mr. Flaggon was an interesting and a
distinguished preacher; his worst enemies
admitted that. He had the gift of saying
what he meant, the happy phrase, and the
inevitable word. But, if his manner could
not but create a favourable impression, his
matter caused serious alarm amongst the staff,
and there was much shaking of heads afterwards
in the great quadrangle under the
shadow of Dr. Lanchester’s statue.</p>

<p>“It’s not so much the sermon,” said Mr.
Pounderly in his most confidential tones;
“it’s the text that frightens me. There were
some points in the sermon, but the text was
full of innuendo.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” exclaimed Mr. Bent, “you are
not going to hang a dog for his collar?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me!” said Mr. Pounderly, “I
hang no man. But, unless my judgment
is strangely at fault, that text, considering
the time and the place, spells upheaval.”</p>

<p>“And the manner!” chimed in Mr. Beadle,
“the assured, precocious manner! The air
of confidence and authority! I agree with
Pounderly that we are marked down for
slaughter; it is the death-knell of the Classics!”</p>

<p>And the two men walked off together
shaking their heads.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler did not content himself
with shaking his head afterwards in the
great quadrangle. He shook it frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and emphatically during the sermon, in
order that everybody might know that he
was in complete disagreement with the
preacher. And on him fell the unpleasant
duty, as he phrased it, of making a reply
and restating the Lanchester position, on
the third Sunday of the Term.</p>

<p>For, needless to say, Mr. Chowdler was
in orders. No mere laymen could have
combined such a capacity for quarrelling
with so profound a conviction of his
own reasonableness and humility. In Mr.
Chowdler’s hands religion became a weapon
to smite with. For choice, he smote lies,
cant, humbug, and Bible critics; but,
occasionally, quite innocent and respectable
things found themselves floored by Mr.
Chowdler’s massive fist and trampled under
his double-welted heel. For, when Mr.
Chowdler mounted the pulpit, necessity was
laid upon him to smite something or somebody.
There were men, like Mr. Plummer,
who doubted whether there would be much
scope in Heaven for Mr. Chowdler’s type of
religion; but, if they did not regard it as
the highest form of Christianity, they had
to admit that it was manly, and therefore
good for the boys.</p>

<p>But, on this third Sunday of the Term,
Mr. Chowdler was no ordinary smiter; he
was the incarnation of the Lanchester spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
repelling a German invasion. And his text,
“Hold fast to that which is good,” was not
delivered like an ordinary text; it was fired
like a six-inch shell full at the stall in which
the headmaster was sitting. Mr. Bent said,
afterwards, that he fully expected to see
Chowdler follow up the discharge of the
text by leaving the cover of the pulpit and
attacking with the bayonet. However, the
preacher spoke daggers but used none.
Change? Yes, change was necessary, growth
was necessary; but not change in essentials
and axioms, not change in the foundations.
Hold fast to the foundations, hold fast to
that which is good! There was a tendency
in a restless, riotous age to imagine that,
because a thing lasted, because it was old
and venerable, it was therefore obsolete.
A fool’s mistake! Why, granite lasts, gold
lasts. Hold fast to the granite, hold fast
to the gold, hold fast to that which is good.
Again, there was a tendency in an age of
feverish and futile activity to assail whatever
is venerable, whatever has withstood the
destructiveness of man and the storms of
time. You tear up the mighty oak, and
replace it by what? Tares? Yes, too often
by tares, or at best by some finnikin exotic
treelet, such as you may see in gaudy Eastern
pots in decadent drawing-rooms. Once more,
hold fast to the mighty oak, hold fast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
that which is good! Fortunately, and God
be praised for it, they had in that place a
great example by which to guide their endeavours—Abraham
Lanchester, their great
headmaster, restorer not destroyer, whose
clear, sane intellect and genius, conservative
in the best and noblest meaning of the word,
had left them an imperishable birthright
and a priceless heritage. Hold fast to a
priceless heritage, hold fast to a great tradition,
hold fast to that which is good!
And so on for five-and-twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon was conscious that he was
being preached at, and he knew that the boys
knew it; for they kept turning round continually
to see how he was taking it. Mrs.
Chowdler, who watched him narrowly, maintained
that he had been profoundly impressed
and “looked as if a new light had suddenly
dawned on him”; but the general opinion
among the boys was that he hadn’t “turned a
hair” and that it was impossible to be sure
whether he had really understood what “Old
Jowler” was driving at.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that the sermon
gave Mr. Flaggon food for reflection; he
certainly sat for some time afterwards in his
study, looking into the fire and apparently
thinking. But, whatever his thoughts may
have been, he kept them to himself and said
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Mr. Chowdler’s effort was much appreciated
on the staff, even by some who were
more prone to criticise than to praise. Mr.
Pounderly pronounced it statesmanlike, and
Mr. Black went so far as to say that it was
inspired. Mr. Bent’s was the only voice that
called it “bosh,” and he received a grave and
well-deserved rebuke from Mr. Plummer for his
lack of reverence. It was confidently assumed
by many that Mr. Chowdler’s serious note of
warning, voicing, as it did, the general feeling
of the staff, would give Mr. Flaggon pause
and force him to recognise facts. But their
optimism was of short duration; for, within
a few days, a notice asking every master to
send in a copy of his weekly routine, made it
clear to the most sanguine that the era of
change and experiment had begun.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MR. TIPHAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be admitted that Mr. Flaggon was
not uniformly lucky in his early experiments.
This was notably the case in his first appointment
to the staff. It has been already stated
that he knew nothing of public schools from
the inside, and, in selecting a successor to
Mr. Cox, he may have been too exclusively
influenced by the claims of intellect and have
taken too little account of other necessary
qualifications. Anyhow, he thought that the
intellectual side of the staff needed reinforcing,
and having a choice between a double
first and a double blue, he appointed the
double first.</p>

<p>Mr. Tipham brought with him from
Cleopas College, Cambridge, two more or
less fixed ideas; first, that art consists
in depicting disagreeable things in a disagreeable
way, and, secondly, that life in the
twentieth century is governed by two conflicting
forces—convention, which is always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
wrong, and Nature, which is always right.
This theory had carried him not only safely
but brilliantly through his university career.
He had secured a first in both parts of the
Tripos; he had played a prominent part in
the life of his own college and been quoted
outside it; he had worn strange clothes,
founded a literary society in which thought
was made to perform queer antics in shackles
of its own imposing, and he had invented a
new savoury. His slightly tilted nose and
full cheeks gave him an air of confidence
which unfriendly critics described as conceit,
while the long brown hair, drawn back over
the temples and plastered down with fragrant
oils, the orange tie and loose green jacket,
proclaimed that he was one of those for whom
art is not merely a hobby but an integral part
of life. One glance at his face would have
informed any ordinarily shrewd observer that,
in approaching new problems and unfamiliar
ground, Mr. Tipham would not suffer from
diffidence. The late Victorians might have
called him untidy and even unwashed; but
at no period in English history would he have
been branded as modest.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that Mr. Tipham should
fall foul of the Lanchester tradition. He
would have fallen foul of any tradition. But
he chose to defy it in most unnecessary and
offensive ways. He smoked as he walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
down to school from his lodgings, he refused
even a perfunctory homage to the claims
of age and seniority, and the scarf that he
wore almost permanently round his throat
(for Mr. Tipham was an indoor man and
sensitive to cold and damp) was a combination
of colours—the colours of the Brainstorm
Club—that shocked the moral sense of Chiltern
by its unblushing æstheticism. Mr.
Chowdler took a violent dislike to him at
their first meeting, and missed no opportunity
of trying to put him down by heavy sarcasm.
But Mr. Tipham was an unsatisfactory butt;
and when attacked he had a way of raising
his eyebrows and inquiring “How so?” in
a bored and superior tone, which goaded
Mr. Chowdler to frenzy.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, soon evident that, if
the serious purpose of Mr. Tipham’s life was
to teach the boys, his recreation consisted
in shocking the masters. To all the things
that they held sacred, the very things that
ought to have impressed him most, he applied
the same disparaging term, “mid-Victorian”
or “bourgeois.” Even the weekly dinner in
Common Room, with its quaint ceremonial
and unique endowment, did not escape the
damning epithet. Before a fortnight had
elapsed, everybody went about saying that
that fellow Tipham was impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. Plummer, whose ideal (never, alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to be realised in this world) was a united
staff, and who was also the last man to abandon
any sinner as irreclaimable, made a final
and unsuccessful effort to bring about a
better understanding. He gave a bachelor
dinner-party, to which he invited a few of
his own friends and the erring Mr. Tipham:
for Mr. Plummer had a touching belief that,
if you can only bring mutually antagonistic
people together over a glass of wine, they
will learn to know and like each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Plummer occupied comfortable rooms
in an old Georgian house that fronted the
High Street. Bit by bit, and with a rare
tact that spared natural susceptibilities,
he had weeded out the furniture and pictures
of his landlady and replaced them with his
own. His taste was eclectic and eminently
characteristic of pedagogic culture, and the
inevitable photographs of the Hermes of
Olympia and the Acropolis found a place
of honour amongst the equally inevitable
Arundels. His rooms were considered the best
rooms in Chiltern, and he was not infrequently
consulted by his colleagues on questions of art.</p>

<p>Mr. Tipham, for whose benefit Messrs.
Bent, Rankin, Grady, and Chase had been
brought together in the Georgian house, began
the evening badly by arriving ten minutes
late and in clothes which protested with unnecessary
vehemence against the narrowness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of convention. At Chiltern it was the custom,
even at bachelor parties, for the guests to
wear dress clothes; but Mr. Tipham scorned
custom. A flannel shirt of that neutral tint
which suggests either dirt or extreme age,
a Norfolk jacket which might well have
belonged to a tramp, and a pair of grey
flannel trousers which the same tramp might
conceivably have rejected, completed his
festive attire, the only note of colour being
provided by the bright orange tie which
flamed beneath an unshaven chin. As Mr.
Rankin said afterwards, he suggested a man
who has snatched up some clothes hurriedly
to run to the bathroom, rather than a guest
at a dinner-party.</p>

<p>But Mr. Tipham was quite unconscious of
the sudden drop in the temperature which
followed his entry. He shot a rapid and
critical glance round the room, and, walking
straight up to a small pastel drawing of a
youth’s head that hung on one of the walls,
he tapped the glass lightly with his forefinger
and inquired:</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?”</p>

<p>“That?” replied Mr. Plummer; “oh, I
picked that up at Chartres for a few francs;
but I don’t know that I care very much for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the best thing in the room,” said
Mr. Tipham quietly; “looks as if it might
possibly be an early Creusot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Nobody but Mr. Tipham had ever beard
of Creusot; so the remark was not taken up,
and the party moved into the dining-room in
depressed silence. At dinner it soon became
apparent that Mr. Tipham was out to give
instruction on other matters than art. The
conversation had drifted, as conversation
often did at Chiltern, on to the subject of
boys. Mr. Grady had complained of their
carelessness in handling chemicals, which
resulted in frequent explosions, and their incapacity
for anything like patient or systematic
research; and Mr. Chase had pointed
out the superiority of the Classics in this
respect, in that they compelled a boy to think
and left no room for experiment. “You’re
both right and both wrong,” said Mr. Tipham
with easy assurance. “Chemistry can be
made very interesting and the Classics very
dull, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The truth is that, if you
want to keep boys interested, you must make
things lively. <i>I</i> always chip in for part of
the time with something quite off the lesson.
To-day I gave them a little lecture on Green
Chartreuse.”</p>

<p>Mr. Plummer, who had long been struggling
with a desire to snub tempered by a sense of
his duties as a host, now cleared his throat and
said, not without an effort:</p>

<p>“I suppose you had a good deal of experience
before you came here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“No,” replied Mr. Tipham tartly; “but I
happen to have been a boy myself.”</p>

<p>And again the temperature fell by several
degrees.</p>

<p>Mr. Bent had so far held himself in reserve,
profoundly annoyed yet watching with a
certain cynical enjoyment the growing irritation
of his colleagues and their inability to
clothe it in appropriate words. But when,
shortly afterwards, Mr. Tipham laid it
down as an axiom that “Dorian Grey” was
the greatest work of art that the human
intellect has ever produced, he saw his opportunity
and began in his best ironic vein.</p>

<p>“Its refreshing to hear you say that; so
few people ever venture, nowadays, to express
old-fashioned opinions; and the Victorians
seldom get justice done to them by the rising
generation. I don’t know that I agree with
you on this particular point, but I am delighted
to claim you as a Victorian.”</p>

<p>If there was one thing which Mr. Tipham
disliked more than another it was to be
identified in any way with the Victorians;
so he raised his eyebrows and said coldly,
“How so?”</p>

<p>If Mr. Bent had been wise he would have
left well alone; as it was, he went on to
embroider the theme a little recklessly. “If
one wants to be in the swim nowadays,”
he said, “one has to go into ecstasies over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
de Barsac or Roger Filkison. You read Roger
Filkison, of course?”</p>

<p>Mr. Tipham admitted, with some reluctance,
that he did not.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s the man, you know,” continued
Mr. Bent, “who writes the testimonials for
the liver and kidney pills—the neo-realism
they call it; very clever and morbid. I
don’t like it myself, but I know several
Cambridge men who think it the most
poignant literature since Verlaine.”</p>

<p>As Messrs. Rankin and Grady were both
Cambridge men, the pleasantry fell flat, and
there was an awkward silence, till Mr. Tipham,
lifting his eyebrows again, said in his most
condescending manner:</p>

<p>“Ought one to be amused?”</p>

<p>And, though Mr. Bent tried to look unconcerned,
everybody realised that he had
been rapped rather smartly over the knuckles.
After this unfortunate incident there was a
general feeling of constraint, which lasted
through the rest of dinner. But when Mr.
Chase had withdrawn to read prayers to his
house, and cigars had been lit in the sitting-room,
Mr. Tipham unbent once more and
became enthusiastic over the merits of the
post-impressionists—the dazzling designs of
Van Googlen, the superb greens of le Beaupère,
and the masterly way in which Grummer
painted flesh with one stroke of a glue-brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“I don’t count him amongst the greatest
masters,” said Mr. Bent, who had recovered
his equanimity, “because he can’t paint
pimples.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied Mr. Tipham loftily, “you
have never seen his ‘Lepers bathing.’”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” said Mr. Bent warmly,
“and I can’t say that I want to.”</p>

<p>“But, in that case,” remarked Mr. Tipham,
“you are hardly in a position to judge, are
you?”</p>

<p>Soon after ten, Messrs. Bent, Rankin,
and Grady rose to go. Their host escorted
them to the door with rather a wan look,
for Mr. Tipham, instead of following their
example, had just lit a fresh cigarette and
dropped into the easy-chair vacated by Mr.
Bent.</p>

<p>“Conceited idiot!” said Mr. Bent, when
the three men were in the street.</p>

<p>“He has a lot to learn about boys,” added
Mr. Grady, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Wants a good scrubbing with soap and
water, inside and out,” growled Mr. Rankin.
“But,” he added, afterwards, privately to
Mr. Grady, “old Bent didn’t get much change
out of him.”</p>

<p>As for Mr. Tipham, he continued to smoke
cigarettes and instruct his host in the first
principles of art till well after midnight.</p>

<p>Among the boys Mr. Tipham was generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
regarded as a freak, and his nickname, “The
Super-tramp,” could hardly be regarded as
flattering. But he had his disciples. Mind
at Chiltern was held in little esteem, and,
where it existed, uncongenial surroundings
were apt to turn it sour. There were generally
a few boys in the highest forms (for the most
part boys of inferior physique and precocious
interests) who were always in a state of latent
revolt against a system which left them out of
account. They repaid contempt with scorn,
and the scorn was all the bitterer because it
seldom dared to express itself in words and
had to ferment inwardly.</p>

<p>To such boys Mr. Tipham appealed as a
breath from a wider world and a champion
of intellectual liberty. At the little dinners
in his lodgings, at which a wine, which had
the alluring title of a <i>petit vin blanc</i>, was
followed by liqueurs, tongues were unloosed,
and thought, if it was not always particularly
clear, was at least delightfully audacious;
and the crudest speculation passed for philosophy.
Acting on a suggestion from their
master, three of the disciples determined to
found a school magazine in which Truth
should at last find a voice. It must be
admitted that the first and only number of
“Veritas” which saw the light, though not
deficient in schoolboy humour, was unnecessarily
personal and occasionally lacking in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
good taste. It contained obvious allusions
to the headmaster, Mr. Grady, and many
other members of the staff; but the most
regrettable item of all was an imaginary
interview, in which, under the transparent
pseudonym of “Howler,” Mr. Chowdler was
held up to ridicule and contempt.</p>

<p>“Veritas” achieved a sensational but all
too brief success. It sold like hot potatoes;
but, within six hours of its publication,
Mr. Chowdler appeared in the headmaster’s
study with thunder on his brow and a copy
of the offensive journal in his hand. The
venture had been anonymous; but the
secret, like most school secrets, had been
badly kept, and both the names of the editors
and the complicity of Mr. Tipham were matters
of common knowledge. Mr. Chowdler
demanded that the editors should be made
to apologise publicly before the whole school.
As for what happened to Mr. Tipham, he did
not care, for Mr. Tipham was beneath contempt;
but the obvious course was probably
the right one. In pressing his demand Mr.
Chowdler was careful to explain that he was
actuated by no desire for personal revenge;
he was thinking only of discipline. At all
costs discipline and the decencies of life must
be preserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon was much annoyed by the
whole occurrence. He had himself suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
to Mr. Tipham, when appointing him, the idea
of stimulating the boys to literary activity;
but, needless to say, he had not intended
the literary activity to take the form of a
lampoon on Mr. Chowdler. However, he deprecated
extreme measures and endeavoured
to soothe the victim’s ruffled feelings. The
unsold copies of “Veritas” were confiscated,
and its further publication suppressed. Mr.
Tipham, to borrow an expressive French
phrase, “had his head washed,” and the editors
offered a full but private apology to Mr.
Chowdler. But Mr. Chowdler was not satisfied.
He maintained that “the empty one” had
behaved weakly to the boys and disloyally
to himself. “A paltry revenge,” he said, “for
my sermon.” Opinion on the staff was divided.
Mr. Chase and the moderates thought that,
on the whole, justice had been done. Mr.
Pounderly and the irreconcilables considered
that “poor Chowdler” had been sacrificed.
Nearly everybody was agreed that the headmaster
was largely to blame; for he and he
alone was responsible for appointing a man
like Tipham—“the Flaggonette,” as he was
facetiously called. Mrs. Chowdler was quite
bewildered.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand,” she said, “how
anyone can be so wicked and spiteful as to
write such things about Harry, for everybody
knows that my husband has gone out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
way to be kind and helpful to Mr. Tipham,
as indeed he always does to all the new
masters. And surely the headmaster must
see that, by not supporting Harry and properly
punishing the offenders, he will weaken his own
position and make himself very unpopular;
for the boys worship Harry.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE CLOVEN HOOF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Mr. Flaggon passed, one October afternoon,
through the green door at the end of his
garden, which led into Colonus, the air was
full of voices that rose alternately to a frenzied
shriek or dropped to a kind of monotonous
chant. For the first round of house-matches
was in progress and reputations were being
lost and won.</p>

<p>Chiltern prided itself on being different
from other schools, and Chiltern had a game
of football peculiar to itself. It was a more
manly game than any other code, and developed
higher moral qualities in those who played it.
As Mr. Chowdler said, no shirker, no humbug,
could hope to win laurels at the Chiltern game.</p>

<p>When Mr. Chowdler’s house was competing
for laurels, Mr. Chowdler himself
walked excitedly up and down the touch-line
with a flushed face and protruding eyes,
shouting, in a voice that dominated all others,
instructions to his boys, such as, “Pass, Percy,
pass! Feet, feet, Gerald! Shoot, Basil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
shoot, can’t you! Stick to it! Good lads
all! Well <i>played</i>, Harry! Well played, sir!”
For Mr. Chowdler always spoke to, and of,
his boys by their Christian names. As a sort
of tribal god, inspiring his children to deeds
of valour, Mr. Chowdler was invaluable; but
as a coach he had his limitations. For he
had been brought up on the Rugby game
and was never accepted as an authority on
Chiltern football. Consequently his instructions
were invariably ignored by the players.
But he continued to shout them in perfect
good faith, and they were regarded as an
inevitable, if irrelevant, feature of the game.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler was in a good temper, for his
house was winning easily, and Mr. Chowdler
liked to win easily. An enthusiast for all
forms of manly sport, he belonged to that
particular brand of good sportsmen who find
it easier to be chivalrous to a vanquished foe
than fair to a victorious one. Accordingly,
on the comparatively rare occasions on which
his house was beaten, Mr. Chowdler always
suspected the referee of partiality and his
opponents of rough play; and, being an
outspoken man, he did not keep his suspicions
to himself. His own boys, less sensitive
perhaps on the point of honour than their
housemaster, sometimes regretted these outbursts,
which did not add to the popularity
of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>But on the present occasion all was going
well and Mr. Chowdler’s temper was unruffled.
The Chaseites (late Coxites) were only serving
as a “sullen ground” to show off the “bright
metal” of their adversaries. So when he
caught sight of Mr. Flaggon approaching,
he left his post of observation on the touch-line
and went to meet him.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, feeling unusually well-disposed
towards the new headmaster, for
there had been a momentary rapprochement
between the two men. Two days before, Mr.
Chowdler had detected a boy in his Form
cribbing—an offence about which he felt very
strongly—and, acting on his advice, Mr.
Flaggon had flogged the culprit; thus reverting
to an old tradition which in the last seven
years of Dr. Gussy’s reign had become obsolete.
With a clear lead of two goals his “lads”
could safely be left to their own devices for a
few minutes, and it would be good for the new
man to see the Chiltern game played in the
true Chiltern spirit and interpreted by one
who was able to explain its ethical value.
For, after all, there <i>might</i> be possibilities in
the “empty one,” and, rightly handled, he
seemed not incapable of being taught.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase apparently thought so too. He
was watching the defeat of his house with
gloomy stoicism from the opposite side of the
ground—a chivalrous Chowdler was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
a little overwhelming—and, catching sight
of the two men in earnest conversation, he
nudged Mr. Bent, who was standing beside
him, and whispered:</p>

<p>“See that? Chowdler’s taking him in
hand; same as poor old Gussy. Shouldn’t
wonder if some of our friends haven’t been
frightened with false fire after all.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” replied Mr. Bent. “Appearances
are often deceptive. Wait and see. Flaggon’s
a dark horse, and there’ll be surprises yet.”</p>

<p>And the first of the surprises came about
a week later at a housemasters’ meeting.
The meeting had been convened, nominally,
for the purpose of discussing the scale of
tradesmen’s charges, which Mr. Flaggon
thought excessive; but, at the close of it,
he said in the most matter-of-fact way:</p>

<p>“As we are here, I should like to say a few
words on another subject. I intend, in the
more or less near future, to introduce certain
changes into our curriculum with a view to
making our teaching more effective. I don’t
know exactly yet what form those changes
will take; but I have two things in my
mind. In the first place, I find that our
standard of scholarship is surprisingly low.
I notice that last year we did not get a
single scholarship of any importance at either
university.”</p>

<p>“We have always discouraged pot-hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
here,” interrupted Mr. Pounderly. “We have
aimed at knowledge—not prizes.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Mr. Flaggon; “but it is
the level of knowledge that I find so low here;
much lower, for example, than it is in several
other schools at which I have examined. And,
in the second place, I am convinced that the
average boy here (I am not speaking of the
scholar) is not getting quite the kind of education
which is best suited to his requirements.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon paused, and if a pin had
fallen it would have been distinctly audible,
so tense was the silence. The challenge had
been thrown down, but everybody waited
for a moment to feel the edge of his weapon
before rushing into the fray.</p>

<p>“I intend to do nothing rashly,” continued
Mr. Flaggon. “I wish the whole subject to
be discussed thoroughly before we decide on
anything final, so that every point of view
may find its expression. And for that reason
I think it would be interesting, and perhaps
helpful, if we could obtain the views of at
least some of our parents on the subject.”</p>

<p>There was a gasp; and Mr. Beadle, the
authority on Plautus, rapped out:</p>

<p>“The parents have already expressed their
views by sending their sons to Chiltern.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said the headmaster. “It
all depends on what alternatives they had.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” pleaded Mr. Pounderly, “surely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to call in the parents would be like calling in
the patient to advise the specialist.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Mr. Flaggon. “The
truer analogy would be to say that we are
like the specialist who consults the patient’s
relatives about the patient’s symptoms. And
the relatives are often able to give very
helpful information to the specialist.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to propose,” said
Mr. Chowdler in a voice of concentrated
irony, “that we should call in their uncles
and cousins and aunts and make a regular
symposium of it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon winced, but he kept his
temper.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” he said, “that in this case
there would be any practical advantage in
going beyond the parents. What I wanted
to say was, that I shall be very grateful if
housemasters will let me have the names and
addresses of any representative parents who
are likely to be interested in such a proposal.
I thought perhaps that we might arrange to
meet them, quite informally, some time in
November or at the beginning of December.”</p>

<p>“What exactly do you mean by a representative
parent?” asked Mr. Flyte, with the
air of a man who is putting a poser.</p>

<p>“I must really leave that to the discretion
of housemasters,” replied Mr. Flaggon, with a
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>News of the impending parents’ committee
ran through the staff like fire through gorse,
and soon all Chiltern was ablaze. Some
called it the thin edge of the wedge; others,
the cloven hoof. The Liberals (for there were
a few Liberals even at Chiltern) said that
Flaggon was setting up a second Chamber to
override the decisions of Masters’ Meetings;
the Conservatives, that he was appealing to
Demos. All agreed that the innovation was a
blow to the prestige of the masters and an
infringement of their ancient rights. Even
Mr. Plummer felt and spoke strongly, and he
imparted his fears to Mr. Bent, as they were
taking the hill walk, commonly known as
the “Ushers’ Grind,” one sunny autumn
afternoon.</p>

<p>The friendship of Mr. Bent and Mr.
Plummer was founded on a complete dissimilarity
of tastes. It is true that they
shared a dislike of golf and motors, but in all
other respects they were in hearty disagreement.
Mr. Plummer’s faith in man goaded
Mr. Bent almost into violence, and Mr. Bent’s
distrust of human nature in general, and
middle-class human nature in particular,
filled Mr. Plummer with righteous indignation.
At the end of every walk the nerves of each
were raw and tingling; but they never failed
to walk together twice or even thrice in the
course of every week. The particular form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of quarrelling in which they indulged had
grown upon them like a drug habit, and neither
could do without it for long.</p>

<p>A stranger who knew them by reputation
but not by sight would inevitably have
mistaken each for the other. Mr. Plummer,
tall and thin, with a hooked nose, hollow
cheeks, and sallow complexion, looked the
embodiment of pessimism; while Mr. Bent,
short, stout, with round eyes and a florid
face, ought to have been a born optimist.
Mr. Rankin used to say that Providence
had designed the character of the one for the
person of the other, that a malicious fairy
had negotiated an exchange, and that they
sought each others company because, apart,
they were both conscious of being incomplete.</p>

<p>But on this occasion, as we have said,
Mr. Plummer was inclined to be pessimistic.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this idea,” he said, “of calling
in an outside opinion. If the parents once
get it into their heads that they are able to
dictate, there will be an end of systematic
teaching.”</p>

<p>“My good Plummer,” replied Mr. Bent,
“there cannot possibly be an end, because
there has never been a beginning. Systematic
teaching indeed! Why, a boy told me the
other day that he had been doing the same
French book ever since he came to the school
two years ago; and it is notorious that Cox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
set one and the same Latin prose every Term
to his Form, and never looked it over.”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of organisation,” said
Mr. Plummer, “I was speaking of principles;
and I repeat, if the parents are allowed to
dictate the lines on which education is to
proceed, there will be an end of systematic
teaching.”</p>

<p>“They will not dictate,” said Mr. Bent;
“they have no manuscript to dictate from.
Their theories on education are purely negative—I
say, steady up the hill! The only
thing they insist on is that their offspring
should not be taught to think or know.
Thought and knowledge are dangerous to the
existing social order and must be smothered
young, like the Princes in the Tower. Provided
that they <i>are</i> smothered, the parents
don’t care a rap what sort of pillow is used.”</p>

<p>“Thought,” said Mr. Plummer, “hardly
exists outside the middle classes.”</p>

<p>“Knowledge,” retorted Mr. Bent, “only
begins where middle-classdom ends. The art
of being middle class consists in shutting
yourself up in a detached house and only
recognising the people who come in at the
front door. Knowledge leads to the back
door and the streets, and is therefore fatal
to the art; and knowledge is the goal of
education.”</p>

<p>“If parents didn’t believe in education,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
said Mr. Plummer, “they wouldn’t send their
boys here.”</p>

<p>“The English middle classes,” said Mr. Bent,
“never have believed in education. The
Scotch did once, till they discovered the
superior merits of football; but the English
never. And they send their sons here to be
inoculated against it—I say, <i>do</i> go a bit
slower. For choice they put them with
Chowdler, who returns them, in a few years,
finished specimens of Philistinism, with orthodox
views on Bible criticism and the off-theory,
and a complete lack of interest in
anything that really matters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t at all agree with you,” said Mr.
Plummer; “but, if the parents are such
hopeless idiots as you describe them, why
do you want to consult them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” replied Mr. Bent. “But, if
they are such angels of light as you imagine
them, why do you object to asking for their
advice?”</p>

<p>“You are paradoxical,” snapped Mr.
Plummer.</p>

<p>“And you are illogical,” panted Mr. Bent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE AFFAIR OF LE WILLOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Mr. Chowdler was lamenting that
discipline was going to the dogs, the boys
were beginning to complain that liberty was
being destroyed. Some of them went so far
as to maintain that Chiltern was becoming a
regular preparatory school. For not only were
motor-bicycles forbidden (they had always
been <i>that</i>), but it was becoming positively
dangerous to ride them. Moreover, detection
entailed consequences. In the palmy days of
Dr. Gussy it had been the ambition of every
boy, caught in a misdemeanour, to be reported
to the headmaster; and the appeal from
summary justice to Cæsar had been one of the
most cherished privileges of Chiltern whilst
Dr. Gussy was Cæsar. For Dr. Gussy believed
in talking—earnest, practical, confidential
talking. As the boys said, “Gus treated you
like a gentleman”; whereas Flaggon—there
was no pleasure, nothing morally bracing,
about an interview with Flaggon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>And other offences besides motor-biking
were being detected with alarming frequency.
Masters, who had hitherto been regarded as
quite inoffensive, seemed to take a pleasure
in appearing where they were least expected.
The truth is that, having less belief in Dr.
Gussy’s talks than Dr. Gussy himself, they
had got into the habit of purposely avoiding
knowledge which they knew would lead to no
result; but, finding that Mr. Flaggon was
prepared to act as well as talk, they resumed
their normal activities.</p>

<p>No inconsiderable factor in the growing
absence of security was the disappearance of
“Whisky Toddler,” the college porter. When
he paid his surprise visit to Chiltern in the
holidays, Mr. Flaggon had been conscious of a
subtle aroma about the place, which ceased
suddenly when he took leave of the porter;
and the suddenness of the change had set him
wondering whether the extreme solemnity
of Mr. Todd was due solely to wisdom or was
partly induced by alcohol. The wonder did
not diminish on closer acquaintance, and an
unexpected visit to the Lodge, one evening,
settled all doubts. Mr. Todd was found in
a state of hilarious incoherence. It was, of
course, an accident—a toothache, and an old-fashioned
remedy, recommended by a friend,
which had produced unforeseen results in
one unused to spirituous liquors. Mr. Todd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
refused with quiet dignity to purchase the
chance of reinstatement by taking the pledge
and spending a month in a home for inebriates.
He preferred to retire, at once, on a quarter’s
salary and a small pension.</p>

<p>The boys, of course, had always known
that “Whisky Toddler” drank like a fish;
but opinion on the staff was acutely divided.
There is no question that has so many sides
to it as drink, nor one about which it is so hard
to arrive at any convincing conclusion. The
very fact that Mr. Todd’s nose was red and
his eyes were watery was, to some, a proof of his
innocence. For people are sure to say that a
man with a red nose and watery eyes drinks;
whereas anyone <i>may</i> have a red nose and
weak eyes without drinking, and it is horribly
unfair that a man should be treated as a moral
leper because of some physical infirmity.
There were many, therefore, besides Mr.
Plummer who believed, and still believe,
that poor Todd was “hardly treated”; and
poor Todd said nothing to discourage their
belief.</p>

<p>His place was taken by a man of unprepossessing
manners and abrupt activity—Pigeon
was his name. There was a certain
mystery about his past. Some said that he
had once been a spy in the pay of the Russian
police; others, that he had been a proctor’s
bulldog at Oxford; others, that he had been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Scotland Yard detective. At all events, there
could be no doubt that it was as a detective
that he was brought by the “New Gus” to
Chiltern. A porter is assumed to possess
tact; but Pigeon had none—no gift of shutting
his eyes on occasions when eyes are better
shut. And so it came to pass that he discovered
Mr. Chowdler’s Prætor smoking
among the rhododendrons in Colonus, and
reported him to the headmaster.</p>

<p>At Chiltern the captain of every house
was called its “Prætor” and wielded vast
authority. In a post for which character
was the prime consideration, position in the
school was only of secondary importance.
Hence it happened that, though le Willow
had with difficulty fought his way into the
senior Fifth, he was Prætor of Mr. Chowdler’s
house. But, though not distinguished intellectually,
he was captain designate of the
eleven for the succeeding year, a very fair
change bowler, and a bat with a most taking
style. He enjoyed the entire confidence of
his housemaster and the respect of his fellows.
It was regrettable, therefore, from every point
of view, that he should have been smoking
behind the rhododendrons in Colonus; and still
more regrettable that, having been smoking,
he should have been discovered.</p>

<p>Enough has been said already of Mr.
Chowdler to make it clear that he was adamantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
on the question of discipline. But it
was a matter of common observation amongst
his colleagues that his attitude towards offences
underwent a considerable change when the
offender was one of his own boys. This is a
species of infirmity to which parents and
housemasters are peculiarly liable. In Mr.
Chowdler’s case it took the form of a
conviction that, though “his lads” might be
technically in the wrong, they were morally
quite sound; and he always held that punishment
ought to take account of the character
of the offender. He was really pained by le
Willow’s “thoughtlessness”; but there were
extenuating circumstances. The boy was encouraged
to smoke at home, and he had one of
those muddled old heads that find it so difficult
to draw the distinction between home and
school; especially when the home is a good
one. The poor old fellow had admitted to
him (Chowdler), with a shake of his poor old
head and a look in his poor old eyes which
was really pathetic, that he knew he was a
“blighted ass.” He was, in fact, just the kind
of boy for whom justice should be tempered
with mercy.</p>

<p>All this, and more, Mr. Chowdler said to
the headmaster on behalf of his Prætor, and
he was profoundly shocked when Mr. Flaggon,
after listening attentively to the counsel for
the defence, announced that he was going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
deprive le Willow of his Prætorship and
Prefectship, not merely temporarily, but for
the term of his natural life. “I fail to see
where the mercy comes in,” growled Mr.
Chowdler.</p>

<p>“Perhaps in my not flogging him into the
bargain,” replied Mr. Flaggon. “But, really,
I don’t consider this a case for mercy. The
boy is in a position of trust. Five days ago
I called the Prefects together and spoke to
them about their duties, especially the duty
of setting a good example: and I mentioned
smoking by name. All the circumstances
aggravate the offence. I have no right to be
merciful.”</p>

<p>“But probably he didn’t understand,”
pleaded Mr. Chowdler. “You don’t know
what a business it is to drive any idea into that
poor, thick old head of his. The boy’s as
honest as the daylight, but terribly obtuse.”</p>

<p>“If he can’t understand a plain speech
and a plain duty,” replied Mr. Flaggon, “he
is certainly not fit to exercise power.”</p>

<p>“You can’t prevent a boy with such athletic
gifts and such a sunny nature from exercising
power by any official ukase,” said Mr. Chowdler,
with increasing warmth. “If you destroy
his self-respect by a punishment which he feels
to be unjust, you take away from him all
motives for doing right; you drive him into
evil courses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I intend my Prefects to govern,” replied
Mr. Flaggon; “and you can never get men or
boys to act responsibly unless you visit grave
breaches of duty on them heavily. I am sorry
for le Willow, if he is all that you describe
him; but I cannot alter my decision.”</p>

<p>“You admit then,” snapped out Mr.
Chowdler, “that you are sacrificing the boy
to an abstract theory.”</p>

<p>“I admit nothing of the kind,” said Mr.
Flaggon.</p>

<p>A good many of the masters, who did not
share Mr. Chowdler’s enthusiasm for le Willow,
approved of the headmaster’s action; and,
though they did not say so publicly, were
not sorry to see Mr. Chowdler’s straying sheep
treated for once in a way like other people’s
straying sheep. But Mr. Chowdler himself
made no attempt to conceal his displeasure
either from masters or boys.</p>

<p>“I don’t call that kind of thing discipline,”
he said; “I call it panic. A strong man
doesn’t hit about wildly without caring where
the blow falls. With all his faults, dear old
Gussy was never unjust. Le Willow’s too
good an old fellow at bottom to be soured for
long or lose his sunny nature. But that’s
how criminals are made.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler’s views received a striking
corroboration, at least in his own eyes, when,
three weeks later, le Willow was caught cribbing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
It is true that Mr. Bent, his Form master,
had suspected him for the greater part of
two terms; but, as Mr. Plummer said, suspicion
proves nothing. In the midst of his
grief Mr. Chowdler was almost triumphant.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” he exclaimed.
“You can see now for yourselves. That’s
how boys are driven into evil courses.”</p>

<p>But the headmaster, instead of recognising
the folly of his ways and apologising to Mr.
Chowdler and his ex-prætor, decided that,
after this second offence, the boy could not
remain in the school and must leave at the
end of the Term.</p>

<p>Dismiss the captain of next year’s eleven,
a bat with the most taking style that had
been seen at Chiltern since the days of Goring
who played for England, and a very fair
change bowler into the bargain! All Chiltern
was aghast, and even Mr. Chase, who usually
had something to say on behalf of the headmaster,
admitted that it was an act of doubtful
wisdom.</p>

<p>To Mr. Chowdler it was not merely an act
of doubtful wisdom, it was a travesty of
justice, an outrage, a scandal—in fact almost
any strong word that you can think of. When
a man thinks as strongly as Mr. Chowdler
thought about some gross miscarriage of
justice, it is impossible for him to keep his
feelings to himself; he would rather be guilty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of indiscretion than of a criminal silence;
and soon boys, masters, and the parents and
relatives of the victim, were in full possession
of Mr. Chowdler’s opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>Le Willow was well connected; in fact,
as Mrs. Chowdler put it, he had a grandfather;
and the grandfather wrote a letter to the
chairman of the Council which caused that
gentleman much concern. He wanted to
know why the dickens they had appointed to
Chiltern a headmaster who didn’t know the
ABC of his profession. Expel from school a
promising lad for a boyish offence of which
they had all been guilty, probably, in their
day! The thing was absurd. Boys and
masters alike were in a state of mutiny; and
he called upon the chairman to intervene.</p>

<p>The chairman was perplexed; for the grandfather
was no ordinary grandfather but a
man with a commanding name and a great
social position. After some hesitation he
wrote to the headmaster, disclaiming any
idea of interfering, but asking for information.
He wished, he said, to be in a position
to contradict certain reports, unfounded no
doubt, which were being circulated in the
London clubs and which might damage the
school.</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Mr. Flaggon wrote a
detailed account of the affair and of the
principles which had guided his own action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
He added that the tone and discipline of
Chiltern were very different from what he had
been led to expect, and that le Willow, besides
being somewhat old for his place in the
school, was not a desirable asset.</p>

<p>The chairman shook his head dubiously
over this communication and murmured something
about “new brooms” and “excess of
zeal”; but he informed the grandfather
with much tact that, though the Council felt
great sympathy with him, they were unable
to interfere in a matter that directly concerned
the discipline of the school, and that
any appeal for mercy must be made to the
headmaster in person. As for le Willow,
he was sure that the boy had a brilliant
future in front of him, and he wished him
every success.</p>

<p>And there the matter ended, except that
the le Willow parents cursed Mr. Flaggon
by all the le Willow gods and threatened to
bring an action; which threat they were wise
enough not to carry into effect. Also that Lord
Chalvey withdrew his son who was entered
for Mr. Chowdler’s house in the following Term.
This was a contingency which Mr. Chowdler
had not foreseen when he started on his
campaign, and it did not help to reconcile
him to the headmaster.</p>

<p>And, while the chairman was actually penning
his reply to the duke, one wet November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
afternoon, Mr. Plummer and Mr. Bent were
once more pacing the “Ushers’ Grind” in
mackintoshes. A steady drizzle had damped
their fighting spirit, and taunts that usually
kindled flames had only produced a perfunctory
fizzle. At last Mr. Plummer said:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the boys haven’t a great
respect for Flaggon.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t take Chowdler too seriously,”
said Mr. Bent.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say Chowdler,” replied his companion;
“I said the boys.”</p>

<p>“I know you did,” said Mr. Bent. “And
<i>I</i> said Chowdler, because I bet that he has
been telling you his story of the week—we
have all heard it—to wit, how little Simpkin
looked up at him with a wistful smile and
said, ‘Sir, do you think the new headmaster
understands anything about boys?’”</p>

<p>“Suppose he did!” said Mr. Plummer
defiantly. “What then?”</p>

<p>“Only,” replied Mr. Bent, “that it isn’t a
<i>very</i> likely thing for a boy to say, on his own.
I know little Simpkin; he’s in my Form. All
Chowdler’s pets are in my Form. A nasty,
greasy, oily little beast. He tried ‘the wistful’
on with me once, but never again.”</p>

<p>“The fact that you think him oily and
greasy,” retorted Mr. Plummer, “is no proof
that he didn’t say it.”</p>

<p>“I never said it was,” cried Mr. Bent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
raising his voice, “and I don’t doubt that
little Simpkin <i>did</i> say it and will say it again
till he gets another cue. What <i>does</i> amaze me
is that, with all his experience, Chowdler has
never learned that boys encourage us in our
illusions by quoting at us our own pet ideas
and phrases. It isn’t conscious hypocrisy—merely
an instinct of self-preservation, or an
amiable desire to please. They approach us,
as <i>we</i> should approach some beast of uncertain
temper, with the sounds that experience has
shown to be most soothing.”</p>

<p>“So you have said before,” snorted Mr.
Plummer. “But, anyhow, you admit that
Chowdler has experience; and Flaggon has
none.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! experience indeed!” cried Mr.
Bent contemptuously. “What’s experience?
A snare and a delusion, unless you can bring
an unbiassed mind to bear on it; which
schoolmasters never can. The man who
looks at this view, for the first time, with the
naked eye, sees far more of it than the man
who looks at it for the hundredth time through
smoked glasses. Experience is the smoke on
the glasses; it’s the curse of our profession.
We are all much more efficient when we’re
young than we ever are afterwards. Give
<i>me</i> the young and inexperienced man.”</p>

<p>“Tipham, for example,” said Mr. Plummer
drily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Oh, Tipham’s an exception,” replied
Mr. Bent airily. “Tipham never <i>was</i> young.
He was born with a greased head, grey flannel
trousers, and a terror of being thought sane.
But I can tell you, Chowdler was ten times
more efficient as a master fifteen years ago,
when you and I first came to the school, than he
is now. We all become progressively greater
idiots as we grow ripe in experience.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” said Mr. Plummer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE PARENTS’ COMMITTEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the last day of November the much-talked-of
Parents’ Committee met. Mr. Flaggon’s
attention had been so fully occupied by other
and more pressing affairs that he had not had
time to prepare for the event as carefully as
he could have wished. Indeed, the purely
educational problem had lately taken a less
prominent place in his mind. But some dozen
parents had shown themselves sufficiently
interested in the proposal to promise their
personal support; and, of these, seven actually
put in an appearance on the appointed day.
They included Lady Bellingham, a recognised
authority on Women’s Education, and Sir
Philip Whaley, senior partner in a great
commercial house, director of several flourishing
companies, and a person of considerable
importance in the city. A successful stockbroker,
who happened to be visiting his boy
at Chiltern on the day, was pressed, reluctantly,
into the service at the eleventh hour
and made the numbers even. The meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
was held in the library, a handsome room
that opened out of the Great Hall, and
was intended to be quite informal. The
masters had all been invited to attend, but,
as attendance was optional, a great many of
them marked their disapproval by staying
away. A sense of duty, however, brought
Mr. Plummer and about a dozen others to
this new kind of Parliament, and Mr. Bent
was present, as he expressed it, for the sheer
fun of the thing.</p>

<p>The headmaster stated in a few words the
object of the gathering, and Lady Bellingham
opened the debate. Lady Bellingham was the
star of the occasion, and she had come
provided with a typewritten paper which she
proceeded to read with evident gusto. It was
rather a lengthy paper, and before it was over
Sir Philip Whaley and the stockbroker were
seen to yawn surreptitiously. The gist of it
was that children should be brought up among
beautiful things in order that what is beautiful
in them may be fostered and developed.
Nature is always beautiful, and in educating
the young we must trust more to Nature and
less to artificial restrictions. We must not
interfere with a beneficent purpose, and
Nature’s purposes are always beneficent.
“Nursed on the great bosom of Nature”
beautiful children will grow up into beautiful
men and women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>When Lady Bellingham had finished, Mr.
Bent, assuming his most impressive and
deferential manner, asked if he might put a
question.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Lady Bellingham
affably.</p>

<p>“I do not press,” said Mr. Bent, “for any
definition of what you call ‘beautiful things,’
because that might introduce the personal
element. But, when you urge that we should
impose no restrictions on Nature, I foresee
difficulties. Measles, for example, are a form
of Nature, and of course you would not wish
us to impose no restrictions on measles.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Lady Bellingham,
with amused pity.</p>

<p>“Then might I ask,” said Mr. Bent,
“what exactly we are to understand by
Nature?”</p>

<p>“Nature,” replied Lady Bellingham, “is
impossible to define. It is too vast, too
varied. But, roughly speaking, whatever is
beautiful is natural, and whatever is ugly is
unnatural.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mr. Bent.</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip Whaley, who had long been
chafing under an enforced silence, took up
his parable and spoke. Sir Philip possessed,
in an unusual degree, the charm of English
oratory—the gift, that is, of emphasising and
repeating the obvious and connecting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
rounded phrases with ornamental “ums”
and “ers.”</p>

<p>“You must look at education,” he began,
“from what I venture to call the business
point of view. You schoolmasters are too
inclined, if you will forgive me for saying so,
to ignore, to leave out of account, the—um—er—the
business point of view. But, if you
are going to think Imperially, if, that is, you
are going to think in terms of Empire, in terms,
I say, of Empire, you cannot leave the business
point of view out of account—um—er—you
must take it into your calculations. For,
behind the Imperial problem, lies the business
problem. We city men are familiar with
this truth; it is a matter of common knowledge
amongst us; but it is one of the things that
you schoolmasters, if you will pardon me for
saying so, are inclined to leave out of account.”</p>

<p>“You are forgetting Nature,” interrupted
Lady Bellingham.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam,” replied Sir Philip,
“I am <i>not</i> forgetting Nature, but I am looking
at it from the practical point of view—from
what I have ventured to call the business
point of view. Let me give you a concrete
instance of what I mean.” Here Sir Philip
dropped his voice to a confidential tone.
“When I have a post in my office to fill—I
am speaking, mind you, of a post with prospects
attached to it, a real chance for a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
fellow—um—er—well, what kind of a man do
I want to fill it? A scholar? No. A man
who can read Homer and write Latin verses?
No. I am saying nothing against Homer as
Homer, mark you, but I am considering the
thing from the practical point of view. What
<i>I</i> want is a man who has learned shorthand
and can write commercial French—um—er—and
I don’t find him—that’s the point—I
don’t find him in the public schools or the
universities; as often as not I am obliged
in the end to bring in a foreigner—a German.
That’s where the Germans are ahead of us.
Well, there you have it in a nutshell. The
public schools of England are not seriously
training their boys to take their proper place
in the business life of the Empire; and the
Germans are. That,” he concluded, bringing
his fist down on the table in front of him,
“that is what I mean by saying that you
ought to look at education from the business
point of view. I hope I have made myself
clear.”</p>

<p>Sir Philip wiped his brow and looked
around with a complacent smile. The headmaster,
whose face while the city oracle was
speaking had been a study, made no comment;
but Mr. Bent leaned forward with knitted
brows and began:</p>

<p>“I have been much interested in what Sir
Philip Whaley has been telling us, but I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
not sure whether I interpret him correctly.
Do I understand him to say that he wishes
shorthand and commercial French to form a
necessary part of the school curriculum?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Sir Philip, “most certainly I
do.”</p>

<p>“I realise,” continued Mr. Bent, “that for
anybody who is aspiring to a post in Sir Philip
Whaley’s office, shorthand and commercial
French are a necessary branch of culture.
But what about the boys who are going in for
the learned or other professions—the Church,
for example? Might not commercial French
be, to a future bishop, what Homer is to Sir
Philip himself, an ornamental but irrelevant
accomplishment? And we must not ignore
the bishops.”</p>

<p>“You must specialise,” said Sir Philip
grandly. “You must be prepared to fit every
boy with the special knowledge that he—um—er—will
require in the profession of his
choice. You schoolmasters, if you will forgive
me for saying so, do not sufficiently realise
the importance of specialising.”</p>

<p>“The difficulty of specialising beyond a
certain point,” said Mr. Flaggon, “lies in the
additional expense: and public school education
is costly enough already. Our problem
is to find a common basis of education for
all.”</p>

<p>Sir Philip was not accustomed to have his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
judgment disputed, and he met the objection
by repeating his previous remarks with amplifications.
When he had finished for the
second time, a Mrs. Sparrow, who had been
making chirruping little noises to herself all
the while, seized the opportunity to say
that, for want of somebody better, she had
come to represent the mothers’ point of view;
and what mothers cared most about were just
the little things that men so often didn’t
notice. She was sure that the food was all
that could be wished for or desired, and she
wasn’t for a moment complaining about <i>that</i>.
But she did think that the boys weren’t given
enough time to eat it in. She was horrified
at the way her own boy had learned to gobble
his food in the holidays, and all doctors were
agreed about the importance of eating slowly
and biting properly. That was one thing.
And, then, she did think that, for a big school,
the sick-house was <i>rather</i> a dreary place—such
bare unfurnished rooms and floors.
When her boy was ill last Easter Term and
she came down to see him, she went away
feeling quite depressed. Of course everybody
was <i>most</i> kind, and she knew that the school
doctor was a very clever man; but she did
think that the sick-house might be made a
little more cheerful. That was the mothers’
point of view, and she hoped that Mr. Flaggon
would not mind her putting it; for, after all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
a mother <i>did</i> know more about her own
children than anybody else did.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon said that he was always
delighted to hear what the mothers had to say,
and he would give due weight to Mrs. Sparrow’s
suggestions; but he thought that they were
perhaps straying a little beyond the scope
of the meeting, and he invited the other
parents to give their view on the main subject
under discussion, namely, education.</p>

<p>The other parents, thus appealed to,
explained that they had come to listen and
not to talk; but the stockbroker, who had
from the first exhibited symptoms of acute
boredom, remarked that, as he was there,
he might as well say what he knew that
most people thought, though apparently they
were afraid to say so. “If you ask me,”
he said, leaning back in his chair and thrusting
his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat,
“if you ask me, I don’t think it matters a
rap <i>what</i> you teach ’em. When I was at
school, <i>I</i> never did a stroke of work—had
a jolly good time, and I can’t say that I’m
sorry for it. And I’m worth now” (here
Mr. Flaggon winced visibly)—“well, it doesn’t
matter what I’m worth; but I know that
I could buy up half the swots—that’s what
we used to call them in my days—half the
swots who worked ’emselves silly over their
Latin and Greek and all that sort of gibberish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
And when I sent my youngster here, I said
to him: ‘You may work if you like; you
can please yourself about that, and it’s a
point you’ll have to settle with your masters;
but, if you want to please your dad, remember
that I’d a da—jolly sight sooner see you
head of your eleven than head of the school.’
That’s what I said; and I don’t believe,
Mr. Headmaster, that you’ve got a finer
little sportsman in your school than my
youngster.”</p>

<p>Long before the discussion was over
Mr. Flaggon realised that it had been a
mistake and would only give the enemy
cause to blaspheme. And he was not mistaken.
Lady Bellingham was the joy of Common
Room for weeks afterwards, and it was
humorously assumed that she had made
a convert of the headmaster. When a new
chimney appeared on the Lodge, everybody
said, “Flaggon is surrounding us with beautiful
things”; when the rhododendrons at the
far end of Colonus were thinned out, it was,
“Flaggon is uncovering the great bosom of
Nature.” And again, when a notice came
round about the wearing of great-coats, somebody
remarked that Flaggon was looking at
education from the mothers’ point of view.
Mr. Chowdler, who had not been present
at the meeting, picked up all the best things
and added them to his repertory. In fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
there was a regular carnival of wit, and the
wags had the time of their lives.</p>

<p>Only Mr. Bent affected to be agreeably
surprised. “They were,” he said, “an
unusually intelligent set of parents—quite
unusually intelligent. Lady Bellingham, of
course, talked an amazing lot of drivel;
you would expect that from a woman. Still,
she knows a great deal more than Chowdler
does; for, though she can’t express herself
rationally, she does realise in a vague way
that beauty is a form of truth, and that
education ought to mean something more
than Balbus-built-a-wall and the off-theory.
Even Mr.—I can’t remember his name—the
stockbroker, has grasped what education
is <i>not</i>; which is more than Chowdler ever
has. They offered him an inferior substitute
at the school where he spent his dazzling
youth, and, with the intuition of genius, he
divined that it was not worth his acceptance.
And probably it wasn’t. And, then, the
silent ones! How seldom you find four people
in any given room who are wise enough
to keep silence about a subject of which they
know nothing. Whaley was the only really
hopeless failure. Yes, they certainly were
an unusually intelligent set of parents.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” protested Mr.
Plummer, “but if <i>I</i> had said so, you would
have cursed me for my unreasoning optimism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and made out that I was blinded by my
infatuation for the middle classes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied Mr. Bent airily,
“perhaps. And very likely I should have
been right.”</p>

<small>“GOD’S IN HIS HEAVEN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I always</span> wonder, Bent,” said Mr. Rankin,
as the two men met in Colonus on their way
to the ground where the Cock-house match
was about to begin—“I always wonder why
you, who pour such scorn on athleticism,
never by any chance miss a house match.”</p>

<p>“There are many things in this world to
wonder at,” replied Mr. Bent; “for instance,
why the sea is boiling hot and why Radicals
are the most inveterate Tories in private life.
But, as a matter of fact, it is not the football
that attracts me on these occasions so much
as the psychology of the competing housemasters.”</p>

<p>“Translate with brief notes,” said his
companion.</p>

<p>“To an observer of human nature,” Mr.
Bent explained, “nothing is so illuminating
as the behaviour of a housemaster when
his house is playing a match. Chowdler, of
course, is elemental, and offers few points of
interest; he has the naked simplicity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
savage or the sportsman—blatant in victory,
ungenerous in defeat. But Trimble is more
complex, and, therefore, more worthy of study.
If I join him, he will affect an air of complete
detachment and ask me for my views on
Welsh Disestablishment or Woman Suffrage;
but he will interrupt himself at intervals to
murmur ‘Fools! asses! idiots! they deserve to
be beaten!’ Of course they <i>will</i> be beaten?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that!” said Mr.
Rankin. “Two of Chowdler’s best men are
crocked, and Trimble’s have come on a lot
lately.”</p>

<p>“Chowdler being beaten,” said Mr. Bent,
“is a much more amusing spectacle than
Chowdler winning. But I don’t regard it as
possible. He always keeps a reserve force—a
kind of territorial army—of lean and hungry
veterans with Christian names, who have
grown old in the service of their country.
I am credibly informed, that his senior fag,
whom I see on the field, is a widower and
maintains a family of four at Brighton.
They all belong to the class which Chowdler
designates as ‘poor old’ or ‘good old’;
and against this combination of age, godliness,
and thrift, no ordinary house eleven stands
a chance.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk rot,” said Mr. Rankin,
“<i>I</i> back Trimble’s. They’ll take a lot of
beating to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The whole school and most of the masters
were out to watch the game. Mr. Tipham
was conspicuous in his post-impressionist
scarf, shouting ostentatiously for Trimble’s.
Mr. Grady hovered uneasily on the outskirts,
with the hunted look on his face; perhaps the
noise reminded him of his more uproarious
classes. Mrs. Chowdler and Mrs. Trimble were
seated in a reserved enclosure, exchanging
feline amenities. Their better halves wandered
about on opposite sides of the ground—Mr.
Chowdler on the touch-line, Mr. Trimble a
little in the rear of the spectators, in a
state of internal agitation which would have
made sitting impossible. For the game
was of a most thrilling description. In the
first half Trimble’s did most of the attacking
and crossed over with a lead of one goal to
nothing.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right!” said Mr. Trimble
with assumed nonchalance to Mr. Bent, who
had just congratulated him on the results so
far obtained. “We shall go to pieces sure
enough in the second half! my fellows have a
perfect genius for collapsing. The asses!
If they hadn’t bungled all their chances we
might have been three up.”</p>

<p>It looked as if Mr. Trimble’s gloomy
prophecy were going to be fulfilled; for the
game had hardly been restarted when a foolish
misunderstanding among the Trimbleite backs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
enabled Chowdler’s to equalise; and, before
their opponents had recovered from the shock
and consequent demoralisation, le Willow sent
in a lucky shot which put his side ahead. A
yell of triumph went up from the Chowdlerites
and their supporters, and Mr. Chowdler
himself, in spite of a heavy fur coat, leapt into
the air on the touch-line and beat his gloved
hands one against the other.</p>

<p>“Well played, Harry!” he roared. “Well
played all! Good lads! Stick <i>to</i> it, stick
<i>to</i> it!”</p>

<p>“Given away with a pound of tea!” said
Mr. Trimble with a short mirthless laugh.
“That settles the game; and I must say that
we thoroughly deserve to lose. Did you ever
see such football!”</p>

<p>Mr. Trimble, though he was one of the
best housemasters at Chiltern, was a man of
rather insignificant appearance. The youngest
Miss Gussy had once said of him that he always
looked as if he were wearing somebody else’s
cast-off clothes. On this particular afternoon
he had on an ulster of antique design
and faded yellow colour, which contrasted
unfavourably with the smart coat of his
rival and seemed to brand him as of inferior
rank.</p>

<p>“The moral effect of that last goal,” said
Mr. Bent, whose sympathies were with the
ulster, “may be disastrous; but the game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
is not over yet. I must confess that I am
beginning to be horribly excited. I have
not got your philosophic detachment, Trimble;
and the sight of Chowdler on the touch-line,
clapping his great woollen gloves together,
always arouses most unchristian feelings in
me. I want to see him, not merely beaten,
but crushed, disgraced, annihilated. Well
played! Oh, well played!”</p>

<p>For the Trimbleites, stung by disaster,
had roused themselves to superhuman efforts
and were once more attacking fiercely. There
was a confused <i>mêlée</i> in front of Chowdler’s
goal. Suddenly the referee blew his whistle,
and when the players separated it was seen
that a Chowdlerite was lying disabled on
the ground.</p>

<p>“Did you see that?” cried Mr. Chowdler,
rushing up to Mr. Black, whom he spied in
his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Black was a cautious man and shy
of committing himself to excitable colleagues,
so he replied:</p>

<p>“I was just looking the other way, so
I didn’t see what happened; but I fear
somebody is injured.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most deliberate and
foulest bits of play,” said Mr. Chowdler in
a voice for all to hear, “that I have ever
witnessed. Shameful, shameful! From this
moment I take no further interest in the game.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Good God!” he added suddenly, throwing
up his hands in a gesture of despair, “it’s
le Willow!” And he hurried off to assist the
victim.</p>

<p>Le Willow had sprained an ankle and had
to be helped off the field. When he had been
removed and the players had resumed their
places, it became evident that the referee had
awarded a free kick. “All very well!”
muttered Mr. Chowdler to Mr. Rankin, as
he hurried back to his post on the touch-line,
“but what’s the use of a free kick when it
has cost you your best man!”</p>

<p>It was indeed a poor consolation—merely
a black mark against an unscrupulous foe
who cared nothing for black marks. But
imagine Mr. Chowdler’s horror, indignation,
and dismay, when he suddenly realised that
the free kick had been awarded, not for, but
against his house.</p>

<p>“Monstrous!” he cried aloud, as if
appealing to the silent gods. “Monstrous!
I saw the foul, I saw it myself. A perfectly
monstrous decision!”</p>

<p>But, monstrous or not, such <i>was</i> the
decision and there was no appeal from it.
There was a moment of intense silence, and
then a moan went up from the Trimbleites
and a roar of triumph from the Chowdlerites
as the shot which should have equalised,
passed just over, instead of under, the bar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
For the next twenty minutes the Chowdlerite
goal was literally bombarded. Excitement,
it is true, made the shooting rather erratic;
but, time after time, it looked as if the citadel
must fall. And it <i>would</i> have fallen, but for
Cheeny. When le Willow received his mortal
wound, Cheeny had stepped into his place
as leader; and he was everywhere. It is
the right thing in the Chiltern game for the
leader to be everywhere; that is one of the
features that has made of the Chiltern game
the great moral training that it is. So Cheeny
did his best to be ubiquitous, and played
such a game as had not been played in Colonus
within the memory of that generation—falling,
rising, charging and being charged, stopping
rushes, intercepting passes and spoiling shots.
And, after each unsuccessful attack on the
Chowdlerite goal, Mr. Trimble said calmly,
“That settles it! Silly asses! They deserve
to be beaten!”</p>

<p>As for Mr. Chowdler, the perspiration
stood on his brow and there was a note of
almost despairing appeal in his familiar
rallying cry, “Good lads! Good lads all!
Stick <i>to</i> it, stick <i>to</i> it!” But slowly, at the
back of his mind, a purpose was shaping
itself—a resolve that, if the impossible <i>did</i>
happen and Cheeny kept the goal intact,
then Cheeny should be his Prefect. For a
lad with such nerve and courage had proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
himself fit to govern, even though he were
rather low in the school.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the minutes slipped away,
the excitement grew and grew, and there was
one continuous roar of Chowd<i>lers</i>! Jow<i>lers</i>!
Trim<i>bulls</i>! in all keys and every degree
of hoarseness. People leapt into the air,
slapped each other on the back, threw their
caps on the ground and trampled on them,
and performed all manner of strange and
inconsequent antics. Ten—eight—six—four
minutes more! And then, just at the end,
amid howls of delight from their supporters,
the defence, with Cheeny at their head, broke
away; and, when the whistle blew, the ball
was in mid-field and Chowdler’s were left
victorious by two goals to one.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler was swept away by a wave
of intense, almost religious, emotion. Foul
play, monstrous decisions, past and present
wrongs were all forgotten for the moment.
If the headmaster had come up and grasped
him by the hand, he would have fallen upon
the headmaster’s neck—he would have fallen
upon <i>anybody’s</i> neck. Never since the relief
of Ladysmith, where his own son was beleaguered,
had he experienced such a sense of
thankfulness, joy, and exultation. Perhaps
it was an unconscious association of ideas
which made him say to Mr. Tipham as he
passed him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Thank God! We have kept the flag
flying!”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Mr. Tipham icily.</p>

<p>But already Mr. Chowdler was far away.
He had caught sight of Mr. Trimble’s retreating
figure, and was hurrying after him with the
chivalrous intention of pouring balm into
smarting wounds. Mr. Trimble was, indeed,
making off as fast as he could, in the hope of
avoiding an application of this particular
balm, which he had sampled on previous
occasions and which had always disagreed
with him. His nerves were tingling, and he
was conscious of a feeling of suppressed
irritation which, he knew, would give him
a broken night and spoil life for several days.
Suddenly, a heavy woollen glove descended
on to his shoulder and a manly voice panted
in his ear:</p>

<p>“Condolences, poor old boy, condolences!
My turn to-day, yours, perhaps, to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Mr. Trimble, turning round
and shuddering slightly under the caress.
“Is that you, Chowdler? I was looking for
you; congratulations.”</p>

<p>“Ta,” said Mr. Chowdler, without removing
his hand. “Ta. We were a bit too good for
you, but you put up a tip-top fight. I’m
afraid your lot are a bit done up; it always
tells hardest on the beaten side. I expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
my own lads have had very nearly as much
as they wanted. But <i>what</i> a game!”</p>

<p>It is much easier to congratulate a successful
rival warmly than to receive his
condolences gratefully; and Mr. Trimble’s
vexation pierced through his reply.</p>

<p>“It was indeed,” he replied; “the worst
exhibition I’ve ever seen in a Cock-house
match! On to-day’s form any ordinarily
respectable side ought to have whopped you,
but my lot were simply beneath contempt:
they didn’t deserve to win. Plenty of spirit,
of course: one expects that; but <i>the</i> very
worst football I’ve ever seen in Colonus.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler withdrew his hand and the
balm with it. As he said afterwards to his
wife, poor old Trimble never could take a
beating.</p>

<p>To Mr. Chowdler the victory did not mean
merely that his boys, by superior luck or skill,
had scored one goal more than the boys of
another house. It meant, somehow, that
the Lanchester tradition had been vindicated;
that all that was best and noblest in the place,
all that made the past glorious and the present
fruitful, had, in the face of tremendous odds,
asserted itself in a supreme and convincing
manner. He was glad that his house had
taken the field with two of their best players
away, glad that le Willow had sprained his
ankle and that the referee had been flagrantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
unfair. All things had worked together for
good, and misfortunes which looked like
irretrievable disasters had only served to
enhance the moral sublimity of the victory.
“God’s in his Heaven, all’s right with the
world.”</p>

<p>Something of all this Mr. Chowdler certainly
said to his house in the speech that he made
to them at prayers that evening; and when,
on the following day, little Simpkin looked
up at him with a wistful smile and said, “Sir,
don’t you think that the Lanchester tradition
comes out at football?” he felt that the boys
had the root of the matter in them, too. And
he related the story to all his colleagues in
turn—and to some of them twice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE LANCHESTER LETTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Term did not end without further
unpleasantness. The treatment of le Willow
had created a feeling of deep resentment in
the school, and this feeling was intensified
when Old Chilternians came down and said
that the place was becoming a regular Sunday
school, and that the new man deserved to be
shot. It was known, too, that some of the
masters shared the opinion of the Old
Chilternians, and “the Jowler” was generally
recognised as the champion who was foremost
in defending the old flag against attacks.
Mr. Chowdler himself was quite unconscious
that he had revealed his inner mind to the
boys or fanned the flame of disloyalty. But
there was no doubt that he talked with great
freedom to parents and old boys; and neither
parents nor old boys are invariably discreet.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that, at the
school concert on the last night but one of
the Term, both Mr. Chowdler and le Willow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
received a great ovation which contrasted
forcibly with the very faint cheering that
greeted the entrance of the headmaster. It
was said that there had even been hissing;
but, while some maintained that it had proceeded
from a group of old boys, and some
ascribed it to isolated members of Mr.
Chowdler’s house, others asserted that there
had been nothing of the kind at all. Anyhow,
it was not very marked, and Mr. Flaggon
ignored it. He had a disconcerting way of concealing
his feelings, an air of impenetrability
which suggested, somehow, that he might
have a trump card up his sleeve. The boys
did not like him the better for this. Boys
feel more at home with a man who plays with
all his cards on the table.</p>

<p>But the school got a glimpse into the
working of their headmaster’s mind when
they were summoned into the Great Hall,
just before the last chapel, to hear some
remarks which Mr. Flaggon thought it his
duty to address to them. The Term, he
said, had been an unsatisfactory Term. He
dwelt on the prevalence of cribbing, on the
general slackness of discipline and the apparent
absence of any healthy public opinion
on matters that were vital to the school. He
spoke sternly, but in measured language and
without exaggeration of bitterness, and he
ended with an appeal to the best traditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of the school and the better instincts of the
better boys. There were no threats; but
everybody realised that the speech was intended
as a grave warning.</p>

<p>Many of the masters were considerably
impressed upon it. A few of the older ones,
however, headed by Mr. Chowdler, chose to
regard it as an unwarranted attack on themselves.
The boys listened, as boys will
always listen to easy and effective speaking,
with every appearance of being moved; and
the singing in chapel, immediately afterwards,
was unusually subdued. But, as soon as the
first effect had worn off and the tongues of the
scoffers were unloosed, the discontented spirit
reasserted itself again, and the opinion most
commonly expressed in the houses that night
was that they had been treated like preparatory
schoolboys. A few there were, chiefly boys
in the highest forms, who felt dimly that they
had been brought face to face with a real
man and a nobler conception of life than they
had hitherto realised; but, as yet, they were
only few and they held their peace, leaving
the talking to the malcontents.</p>

<p>On the first morning of the holidays, the
headmaster had a long interview with Mr.
Chase. Mr. Chase was not altogether happy
about his house; no more was Mr. Flaggon.
Indeed, he was not very happy about any of
the houses. In his dealings with offenders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
who had been reported to him in the course
of the Term, he had been painfully struck by
a kind of moral hardness in them, an apparent
imperviousness to the influences that make
life a noble thing. It stamped itself on their
faces in a particular look which was half
defiant, half bored, and a sort of easy insolence
which seemed to mistake itself for good
breeding. And it was something new in his
experience. With the thoughtless, daredevil,
and impetuous temperament his own
school days had made him familiar; but this
was a new type, which seemed incapable of
repentance and met punishment and appeal
alike with the same callous indifference.</p>

<p>And, as he watched the boys’ faces day by
day and week by week from his place in
chapel, he was conscious of a gradual deterioration
in many of them. Bigger boys, who at
the beginning of the Term had suggested, with
all their uncouthness, something of the frankness
and spontaneity of healthy-minded youth,
were growing old and veiled and blasé. Even
among the new boys there were some who had
exchanged the frank and grubby light-heartedness,
natural to their years, for a look of
self-conscious pertness that was decidedly
unpleasing. It seemed as if there were a
blight upon the place, some secret impalpable
influence that was poisoning the springs of
life. Mr. Flaggon had diagnosed it at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
as a lack of discipline, and he had set himself
to fight the evil with heroic remedies. Cost
what it might, he would have discipline.
But he was beginning to suspect that indiscipline
was only a symptom and that he had
not yet penetrated to the root of the mischief.</p>

<p>By his advice Mr. Chase, who was
conscientious if unimaginative, was getting
rid of some of the older boys in his house,
who had been vegetating for a long time in
the lower forms. He now suggested that the
housemaster should try to establish confidential
relations with some of the parents
of his new boys, and find out from them, if
possible, whether all was really well. Mr.
Chase looked dubious. “I don’t quite like
it,” he said. “It seems a little underhand—rather
like going behind people’s backs;
because I have been talking a good deal lately
to my Prætor and to some of the old boys,
and they all assure me that, though there is
a prejudice in the school against my house,
it is really quite right and as good as any.
Besides, I don’t want to alarm parents unnecessarily.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon concealed a slight feeling of
impatience. “We mustn’t,” he said, “allow
ourselves to be bound by a more than Spanish
etiquette. We have got to do the very best
we can for the boys who are under us, and, if
we don’t use whatever help the parents can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
give us, we are surely guilty of a grave breach
of duty. And as for frightening them—no
sensible parent would be alarmed at being
asked to co-operate with us in the interests
of his child. Only, you must choose the right
parents; for I’m really afraid there are some
who don’t mind what happens to their sons,
provided they do well at their games and have
a good time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase yielded to persuasion, and, when
he had gone, Mr. Flaggon sat down to a still
harder task. He had decided that he must
write to Mr. Chowdler. Ordinarily, in handling
a delicate situation, he preferred the spoken
to the written word. But in this case he
felt that he could write more calmly and
sympathetically than he could speak; for
he was conscious that Mr. Chowdler’s voice
and personality jarred upon him, and he feared
that, in an interview, this latent irritation
might betray itself in a tone or a gesture
which would embitter rather than end the
quarrel. Anyhow, something had to be done,
for the situation was rapidly becoming impossible.
Mr. Flaggon was aware of Mr.
Chowdler’s indiscretions. The knowledge had
come to him through various channels; and,
once or twice lately, Mr. Chowdler’s tone
and language to himself had been of a kind
which it is difficult for a headmaster to ignore
with dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The letter was a difficult one to compose,
and Mr. Flaggon weighed his words very
carefully. He tried to recall Mr. Chowdler to
a sense of elementary loyalty. He had, he
said, every respect for differences of opinion,
and he did not expect his own views or actions
to pass uncriticised. But there were limits
to the manner in which such criticisms could
be expressed without doing harm to the school,
and he was bound to say that, on several
occasions, Mr. Chowdler had—quite unconsciously,
no doubt—gone beyond those limits.
He disclaimed any personal animus, and ended
with a generous tribute to Mr. Chowdler’s
many services to Chiltern.</p>

<p>When he had read and re-read the letter
and marked it “private,” he dispatched it by
a messenger and anxiously awaited the reply.</p>

<p>And he did not have long to wait. Whenever
his indiscretions were called in question,
Mr. Chowdler made great play with the word
“gossip.” The headmaster, said Mr. Chowdler,
had evidently been listening to gossip, and
would do well to be more shy of it in the
future. He (Mr. Chowdler) had nothing to
reproach himself with, and he refused to be
held responsible for other folk’s mistakes.
His advice had always been at the service of
the headmaster, but it had been consistently
ignored. People must lie in their beds as
they make them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The headmaster sighed as he read this
answer to his appeal, but he felt that nothing
would be gained by continuing the correspondence
or dotting the “i’s.” He hoped
against hope that, though Mr. Chowdler was
incapable of admitting himself to be in the
wrong, he would lay the admonition to heart
and be more cautious in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon spent the greater part of the
holidays at Chiltern, working a rough draft
of a new curriculum and mastering a great
mass of detail. It was rumoured that his
mother and sister were coming to live with
him in the summer; but at present they
were wintering abroad, and Mr. Flaggon was
alone. In the course of the holidays he
became more closely acquainted with Mr.
Bent. The two men, each out for a solitary
walk, had come from opposite footpaths into
the same lane. Neither was in search of
company, but, as both were obviously bound
in the same direction, escape was impossible.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Mr. Flaggon. “I didn’t
know you were here still, Bent. I thought
you were sure to be in Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Bent; “I have shed my
youthful indiscretions. I still can’t stand
Chiltern in the Easter or summer holidays,
but I have at last realised, with infinite relief,
that at Christmas no place is so attractive as
one’s own fireside. It saves me a world of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
anxious thought and planning. I just run
up to town for the last week-end, and that
gives me the feeling, necessary to the pedagogue,
of having been away and seen
things.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon had not had time or opportunity
to become at all intimate with any of
his staff. He was, as we have said, by nature
rather shy and reticent, and the consciousness
of much latent hostility had made advances
unusually difficult. There had, of course,
been formal calls and dinner-parties; but
neither calls nor dinner-parties lend themselves
to the formation of friendships.</p>

<p>Mr. Bent had been a puzzle to him. The
flippancy of his tone and manner at masters’
meetings had often been annoying; but he
had sometimes said things which suggested
ideals and a breadth of view at variance with
his apparent cynicism. When, therefore, as
they were passing his house, Mr. Bent said,
“Won’t you come in and have a cup of tea?”
Mr. Flaggon accepted the invitation. That
walk and tea led to other walks and other
teas. Mr. Bent recognised in the headmaster
a man of great mental alertness and wide
interests; and Mr. Flaggon discovered an
unexpectedly serious vein in his companion,
veiled, as it often was, under an ironic humour.
As conversation became more intimate, Mr.
Bent ventured one day to express his inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
feelings about Chiltern and the Lanchester
tradition.</p>

<p>“We are haunted here,” he said, “as you
have doubtless observed, by the ghost of
greatness; and it won’t let us speak, or think,
or do. Nothing is so paralysing (the preachers
call it inspiring) as the memory of a great
man. If I want a new Latin prose book, I
can’t have it because Dr. Lanchester taught
out of the old one; and if I want a window
that will open, it is impossible because
Lanchester didn’t believe in ventilation. This,
of course, is fearful heresy, and men have died
on the scaffold for less.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Mr. Flaggon with a laugh,
“that you are so prejudiced against Lanchester,
because I had a proposal to make to you.
I’ve just come into possession of some papers
of his, and I am going to ask you to look
through them for me and see if they contain
anything of real interest. I simply haven’t
got time myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, I wasn’t crabbing the
<i>real</i> Lanchester,” said Mr. Bent; “it’s only
his ghost that annoys me. The <i>man</i> was
an educational reformer, but the <i>ghost</i> is
only a glorified cricket ‘pro.’ What are the
papers?”</p>

<p>“They have been sent me,” replied the
headmaster, “by a Mrs. Core, whose grandfather
wrote the life of Dr. Lanchester.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Probably the best things are in the book
already, but there may be a gem here and
there that has been passed over. Would you
care to do a little sifting?”</p>

<p>“I should love it,” said Mr. Bent. “You
see, we have done what the descendants of
prophet-slayers always do. We have hidden
away <i>our</i> prophet under a showy tomb, built
out of the very stones that slew him.
I should vastly enjoy digging for his bones.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Bent carried home, one day, a
boxful of old papers, and spent several
happy evenings going over them. The gem
of the collection was a little bundle of letters,
written to an intimate friend during the early
years of the doctor’s headmastership, and
so outspoken in their comments on persons
and events that, apparently, the biographer
had been afraid to use them. Such phrases
as “I am determined, God willing, to lift
this school out of the mire into which it has
fallen.... The unruly spirit of the boys
troubles me less than the prejudice of the
masters.... Alexander the coppersmith”
(probably an allusion to the Rev. John
Alexander, at that time second master at
Chiltern) “does me much harm.... I apprehend
more and more clearly that a headmaster
must be a despot.... The moral and intellectual
deadness of these people to the
larger issues of education appals me”—delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Mr. Bent and whetted his appetite
for more. When he returned the papers at
the end of the week, he observed:</p>

<p>“There’s matter enough here to blow up
Chiltern and half the county into the bargain.
Some of the letters are splendid and quite
new, but it would never do to publish them.
People would say they were an impudent
forgery. Lanchester was a much finer fellow
than I realised, and intensely modern. By
the way, I understood he had had difficulties,
but I never knew that he had to begin by
sacking a third of the school and two of the
senior——” But a look on Mr. Flaggon’s
face pulled him up abruptly. “That’s the
worst of headmasters,” he said to himself
afterwards. “The moment you begin to be
natural with them, you tumble up against
the official.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Flaggon was not offended. He
had merely remembered, suddenly and with
a twinge of pain, the difficult problems
that confronted him, and what sharp remedies
he might be forced to employ before they
were finally solved.</p>

<small>MR. CHOWDLER WINS A BATTLE AND MEETS
WITH A REBUFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Term began again towards the end of
January, Mr. Tipham and his many-coloured
scarf were no longer a feature of Chiltern.
He had transferred himself to Cambridge and
tutorial work, feeling possibly that Cleopas
College and the undergraduate were in closer
touch with Nature than Chiltern and the
public schoolboy. Anyhow he was gone, and
his place had been taken by a young man of
less pronounced views, who wore spectacles
and listened deferentially to Mr. Chowdler.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler himself had returned in
splendid fighting form. He had spent the
greater part of the holidays at Sauersprudel,
and he had employed the time in wrestling
and prevailing. Long before “all the vulgar
people that Harry hates so” (we are quoting
from Mrs. Chowdler) flocked out to Switzerland
at Christmas, Mr. Chowdler had discovered
Sauersprudel in the Spitzenthal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
planted the British flag there. It is true that
all the English families who have visited the
place in Mr. Chowdler’s wake speak of themselves
as having discovered it too. But that
does not alter the fact that Mr. Chowdler was
the real Christopher Columbus of Sauersprudel
and the father of the Adler Hotel—at least
as a winter resort.</p>

<p>In the early days of the British occupation
the settlers were not numerous, but they
came regularly every winter. There were,
besides Mr. and Mrs. Chowdler, the Hon.
Fitzroy Plashy and party, Canon and Mrs.
Dubbin, Dr. Cushat and family, Mr. Weatherbury,
K.C., and a few others who had suddenly
realised that sunshine and frost are not
peculiar to the Engadine, and that Sauersprudel
is much nearer to London than St.
Moritz is. These pioneers lived together on
fairly amicable terms, enjoying equal rights,
but possessing no written laws, no organised
constitution.</p>

<p>But, as the tide of cheap immigration
brought strange faces to the Adlerhof in ever-increasing
numbers, the old patriarchal life
was bound to come to an end in favour of
some system more congenial to the British
temperament—one, that is to say, which
would classify the guests and admit of a distinction
between governors and governed.
Accordingly, Mr. Chowdler and the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
families took up the white man’s burden,
formed themselves into a permanent committee,
and set themselves to organise life
on the principles which have made sport
the thing it is. They created a skating
club, a tobogganing club, a ski-ing club, and
a curling club, each with rules and tests and
an etiquette of its own; they appointed
competitions, and decided in what particular
form of dissipation the guests were to indulge
of an evening. In a word, they gave the
Adlerhof the blessings of a firm and orderly
government. With a prescriptive right to
the best rooms and the chief place at
feasts, they were the aristocracy of the
hotel, governing, as befits an aristocracy,
in the interests of the many, but holding
discreetly aloof.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, amongst Britons, one of
the first results of a firm government is a
factious and discontented Opposition; and
the Adlerhof was no exception to the rule.
No sooner had Mr. Chowdler and his friends
assumed the cares of office than murmurs of
complaint began to be heard, feeble at first
but gathering strength with each successive
season. Wild young men and women, athirst
for bandy and bunny-hugs, for impossible
ski-jumps and noisy races along the corridors,
protested that they had not come out to be
drilled like schoolboys but to enjoy themselves;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and they began to question the authority
of the self-appointed committee. Profoundly
ignorant of the past history of the place and
of all that it owed to its aristocracy, they felt
no reverence for Mr. Chowdler and the Hon.
Fitzroy Plashy circling sedately round an
orange, and only wondered why the best
part of the rink was reserved for these old
fogeys and their friends. At last a moment
came when, conscious of their strength, they
passed from murmurs to action. When the
committee arranged a toboggan race, the
opposition organised a ski-ing competition;
when the committee decreed a gymkhana,
the opposition engineered a dance; and the
hotel was divided into hostile camps.</p>

<p>Things were in this critical state when,
on December 28, Mr. Chowdler arrived in
Sauersprudel to lend his powerful support
to the cause of law and order. His annual
appearance had always been treated as an
event of importance in the life of the hotel—obsequious
smiles from mine host and a
flutter among the servants. You would
have thought him a governor returning to
his colony, or a chieftain to his clan. But,
on this occasion, Mr. Chowdler, who had left
his wife at home, was met in the hall by the
landlord with a face of woe. The room
on the first floor with the south aspect,
the room that he had selected as his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in 1896 and which had been specially reserved
for him ever since, had been forcibly annexed
and occupied, a fortnight previously, by a
young English Herr who refused to turn out
for all the Chowdlers in creation. Would
Mr. Chowdler mind going into a room on the
other side of the passage for a few days—a
larger and a better room, though facing
north? The young Herr talked of leaving
very shortly.</p>

<p>“His name?” asked Mr. Chowdler curtly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maurice Veal of London.”</p>

<p>“Bring him to me,” said Mr. Chowdler.</p>

<p>Impossible; the young man had gone
out ski-ing for the day, taking his lunch
with him.</p>

<p>“Then send my boxes up to my room,”
said Mr. Chowdler. “My <i>own</i> room mind.
I will arrange matters.”</p>

<p>The landlord hesitated between fear of
Mr. Chowdler and the danger of losing a
wealthy customer who drank champagne
every night and paid exactly twice as much
for the room as Mr. Chowdler did. But
fear of Mr. Chowdler prevailed; and, when
young Mr. Veal returned from his day’s
sport at five in the afternoon, he found his
own effects in the passage and Mr. Chowdler,
in shirt sleeves, busily engaged in installing
himself in the disputed apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. Veal, though not deficient in bounce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
was not remarkable for his physical proportions.
Perhaps a long and fatiguing day
in the snow, in the course of which he had
taken many severe falls, had damped his
spirits; or, perhaps the sight of Mr. Chowdler
in shirt sleeves, with his broad shoulders,
bullet head, red face, and determined jaw,
was more formidable than anything he had
anticipated. At all events he lost his nerve,
and, after a little bluster and some futile
threats, he withdrew to abuse the landlord,
leaving Mr. Chowdler in possession.</p>

<p>“I engaged this room in 1896,” Mr.
Chowdler shouted after him, “and I intend
to keep it.”</p>

<p>And he kept it.</p>

<p>However, the victory of the bedroom
did not end the campaign against the
committee; it only spurred the enemy to
greater exertions. And young Veal, panting
for revenge, became the recognised leader
of a guerilla campaign. No step that the
committee took was allowed to pass unchallenged;
no rule was made but it was straightway
broken, no notice was posted without
provoking a counter-notice or a parody.
Half the hotel was on terms of active hostility
with the other half. The older men and
their wives stood by the committee, the
younger ones rallied round the banner of
Veal. And a climax seemed to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
reached one afternoon, when Veal and a
friend dashed across the sacred enclosure,
where Messrs. Chowdler, Plashy and Weatherbury
were cutting figures, kicked away the
orange which formed the centre of their
evolutions, and spilled Mr. Chowdler—accidentally,
as they maintained; of set
purpose and malice aforethought, as others
asserted. After this anything was possible.
But the situation was saved by the timely
arrival of Lord Budleigh of Salterton and
his brother the Admiral. By a masterly
stroke of policy they were co-opted on to
the committee before they had been five
minutes in the hotel; and the opposition
collapsed. For even in moments of the
wildest aberration, a hotelful of English
folk knows the value of a lord. Moreover,
Lord Budleigh was a man of courteous and
conciliatory manners, far less exclusive in
his behaviour than either Mr. Chowdler or
the Hon. Fitzroy Plashy, and tolerant of
the vagaries of youth; while his brother the
Admiral, who was out to enjoy himself
and sublimely unconscious of anything amiss,
fraternised with everybody in the most natural
and friendly way. Within eight-and-forty
hours, Mr. Veal found himself without
followers and left the hotel. The committee
had triumphed, and, with the committee,
Mr. Chowdler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“There <i>had</i> been a little unpleasantness
before I arrived,” he said afterwards, in describing
the events, “but I soon settled all
that.”</p>

<p>It will be readily understood, therefore,
that Mr. Chowdler was in no mood to tolerate
rebuffs when he returned to Chiltern. And
yet, as ill-luck would have it, a rebuff of
the most unexpected kind awaited him.
On the eve of his departure for Switzerland
he had written to the headmaster to intimate
that he wished to have Cheeny as a house
Prefect in the following term, and it would
therefore be convenient if the boy were made
a school Prefect at the same time. In all
his past experience a wish of this kind had
been equivalent to a command, and had only
needed the official endorsement of the headmaster.
However, this time, on his return
from Sauersprudel, he found, not the official
endorsement he expected, but a note,
requesting him to come and see Mr. Flaggon
on the matter at his earliest convenience.
The interview was more surprising even than
the note. Mr. Flaggon, it appeared, intended,
when appointing Prefects, to take much
less account in future of mere athletic distinction
and much more of mental ability;
“because,” he said, “although I know that
there are often striking exceptions, brain
power and character are closely allied, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the boy who has brains is more likely to
understand and appreciate high ideals than
the boy who has none. I have gone into
Cheeny’s claims very carefully; and, except
for your high opinion of him, which of course
weighs with me, I can find no reason for
promoting him to such a responsible post.
He is quite low in the school and——”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t have seen him in the
Cock-house match last Term,” interrupted
Mr. Chowdler angrily.</p>

<p>“I did,” replied Mr. Flaggon. “I admired
his spirit and I envied him his agility. But
that kind of spirit alone doesn’t make a
Prefect; and I notice that all his masters
say of him that he collapses before any
difficulty in his work and is inclined to sulk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler was too indignant to speak;
but worse was in store; for Mr. Flaggon
continued implacably:</p>

<p>“But there is another boy in your house
whom I <i>am</i> very glad to make a Prefect.
I mean Dennison. He has earned the honour
by his place in the school alone, and, so far
as I can judge—and I have been studying
him rather closely—he has qualities which
justify me in feeling very hopeful about
him.”</p>

<p>Dennison! Mr. Chowdler nearly had a
fit. Dennison! One of those morbid, cantankerous,
precocious boys, who have none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of the good-fellowship, none of the joy of
life, that are the crown of youth. A boy
with a jealous, sour, carping disposition,
unpopular with his fellows and unresponsive
to his housemaster; a boy without influence
and eaten up by an unhealthy egotism.</p>

<p>“You misjudge him,” said Mr. Flaggon.
“The boy is reserved, rather sensitive, and
shy of expressing himself; but he has
character and a conscience. With guidance
and a little sympathy he will make a very
useful Prefect.”</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> make!” Mr. Chowdler protested
vehemently. <i>He</i> knew the boy as only a
housemaster <i>could</i> know a boy, whereas the
headmaster was only judging superficially.
At no price would he accept Dennison as a
Prefect in his house.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said Mr. Flaggon stiffly, “to
be obliged to force on you as Prefect a boy
with whom you are clearly so much out of
sympathy. But I have quite made up my
mind to make Dennison a school Prefect;
and, of course, if he is a school Prefect, he
must be a house Prefect too.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mr. Chowdler,
scarlet with passion, “I decline to be responsible
for anything that may happen in
my house.”</p>

<p>“Those are serious words for a housemaster
to use,” said Mr. Flaggon gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“They were not spoken in jest,” retorted Mr.
Chowdler, as he left the study; and, though
the headmaster made no reply, he realised
that things could not go on much longer on
this unsatisfactory footing.</p>

<p>From that moment Mr. Chowdler became
a man with an obsession. The mere mention
of the name Flaggon temporarily upset his
mental balance. In all the petty annoyances
of life he saw the hand of Flaggon,
and anybody who was not ready to curse
Flaggon by all his gods became at once
suspect.</p>

<p>At Chiltern, as in all intellectual societies,
the personal doings and idiosyncrasies of its
individual members formed the staple of daily
conversation; and, before the Term was two
days old, Mr. Chowdler knew that Bent and
Flaggon had walked together in the holidays,
taken tea together, and, no doubt, conspired
together. He never <i>had</i> liked Bent—a cynical
egotist (all the people whom Mr. Chowdler
disliked were egotists) with dangerous principles.
He shouldn’t wonder if Bent had been
poisoning the “empty one’s” mind against
Cheeny. Bent always had a grudge against
<i>his</i> boys.</p>

<p>Accordingly, coming across Bent one
morning in the masters’ reading-room, which
adjoined the Common Room, he could not
resist the impulse to attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Well, Bent,” he said, in tones of forced
geniality through which the sarcasm pierced
like a needle, “I’m told I ought to congratulate
you on your promotion. I hear that you
have been privileged to drink deep draughts
out of the Flaggon in the holidays. I hope
you found the beverage stimulating.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bent had returned from his week-end
in town with a chill on the liver which made
him disagreeable to his friends and offensive
to his foes. He flushed with anger,
but forced himself to reply with affected
airiness.</p>

<p>“Very, thank you. And I suppose <i>you</i>
have been rapping tables and communicating
with the spook of Old Lanchester. Did he
tell you, by the way, that I have been reading
some unpublished letters of his, which are
rather sensational and upset most of your pet
theories about the tradition?”</p>

<p>It came as a perpetual surprise to Mr.
Chowdler, whenever they had words, that
Bent did not know how to behave like a
gentleman or answer a civil question civilly.
But this went beyond all bounds. So he
drew himself up and replied with dignity:</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of answering
flippant and offensive questions.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mr. Bent, suddenly
losing his self-control, “I should advise
you not to make offensive and impertinent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
remarks about matters which don’t concern
you.”</p>

<p>Which reply left Mr. Chowdler justly
indignant, and confirmed him in the belief
that Bent <i>had</i> had something to do with the
rejection of Cheeny.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE EXPLOSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Other</span> people than Mr. Chowdler were
dissatisfied with the state of affairs, though
none expressed disapproval with quite such
acrimony. For the first time for many years
the numbers in the school were down. This
was in part due to the deliberate action of
the headmaster. Veterans in the lower forms
of the school had been invited to “move on”;
and the veterans were numerous. But there
was another reason for the shrinkage and one
on which Mr. Chowdler and his friends were
more inclined to lay stress; namely, that
several names had been withdrawn at the
eleventh hour from the January entrance
list. From the nature of its clientèle, Chiltern
was affected, more than most schools, by the
gossip of the London clubs; and, in the
London clubs, opinion was not favourable to
the new régime. The case of le Willow had
created a most unfortunate impression. “<i>I’m</i>
not going to send my boy to a school where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
they sack for cribbing,” said one parent to
another. “Cribbed myself when I was a
boy, and so did all my pals.”</p>

<p>“The new man’s no sportsman,” added
a second, “and the boys simply can’t stick
him.”</p>

<p>“No more can the masters,” interjected a
third. “I met one of them in Switzerland,
and, from what <i>he</i> said, I should say the
place was simply going to pot as fast as
it can.”</p>

<p>In Mr. Chowdler’s eyes the place undoubtedly
was “going to pot.” In season
and out of season he called everybody’s
attention to this lamentable truth, and the
fact that he was unable to prevent it preyed
upon his mind. It preyed to such an extent
that a moment came when he committed an
act which brought on the inevitable crisis.</p>

<p>In the third week of Term the headmaster
convened a special masters’ meeting to discuss
certain matters which he considered urgent.
Not only did he convene it for the particular
time at which Mr. Chowdler was accustomed
to play a round of golf, but the first item on
the programme was the question of Sunday
hours.</p>

<p>Now the Sunday arrangements at Chiltern
were perhaps unusual, but they were hallowed
by tradition and shared, in a way, the sacred
character of the day. Briefly, they left a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
clear break, interrupted only by tea, between
lunch at 1.30 and chapel at eight. Exact
contemporaries of Mr. Chowdler might have
recalled that, in his early days, he himself
had viewed this long interval with disfavour.
But it is no reproach to a man to change
his mind, and, with a riper experience, Mr.
Chowdler had learned to love and value the
Chiltern Sunday. To himself it meant a long
country walk and a most refreshing snooze
afterwards; but that was not the reason why
he valued it. He valued it because it was
so good for the boys; because it gave them,
what no other school gives its boys, time to
know themselves, time for thought, and
especially <i>home</i> thoughts; and because it
made of Sunday what Sunday ought to be,
“a morally recuperative day.” “We must
put our foot down,” he said to his colleagues;
“there must be no tampering with Sunday.”</p>

<p>Masters’ meetings at Chiltern were held
in the library. The headmaster and the
ten housemasters sat round an oak table;
and others occupied chairs wherever chairs
happened to be. This disposition of forces
created a rather invidious distinction between
the juniors and the ten who often abused their
position to make important remarks in tones
which were inaudible to the rest of the
meeting. But the invidiousness was felt
more keenly by the juniors than by the ten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Mr. Flaggon disliked the arrangement for other
reasons. Seated at the head of the table,
<i>primus inter pares</i>, he felt uncomfortably
close to the housemasters and inconveniently
removed from the rest of the staff; and, if
he wished to be heard by all, he had to raise
his voice and speak through, or over, his
immediate neighbours in a way that was
unpleasant for both. He sighed for a dais
and a more elevated seat, and, accordingly,
he had suggested tentatively to some of the
senior men the advisability of holding the
meetings elsewhere. But the suggestion had
given genuine pain. It was unthinkable that
Chiltern masters should meet anywhere but
under the portrait of Dr. Lanchester; and the
only other portrait of Dr. Lanchester was in
the Great Hall, an obviously impossible place.
So, wishing to avoid unnecessary friction,
Mr. Flaggon had resigned himself to the
library for the present. Perhaps, as he sat
with his back to the portrait, he was less
conscious of inspiration than his colleagues.</p>

<p>It was therefore from the traditional place,
at the head of the oak table, that Mr. Flaggon
made the remarks which provoked a scene
memorable in the annals of Chiltern. It had
been borne in upon him, he said, by events
in the preceding Term, that the long interval
between dinner and chapel was fraught
with considerable danger. The danger was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
obviously greater in the summer Term than
in any other, when lock-up was later; and,
some time in March, he proposed to consider
a complete rearrangement of the time-table
for the day. But, for the present, he wished
to make as little change as possible. He was
therefore going to ask housemasters to arrange
for a preparation in their houses at half-past
four on Sundays. Tea would be at 5.30 and
chapel at the usual time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chowdler had come to the meeting
in the worst of tempers. Apart from the fact
that he was deeply attached to the <i>status quo</i>,
he had been deprived of his golf, and, being a
man full of habit of body, he could not afford
to miss his exercise. And so, the headmaster
had scarcely finished speaking, when he broke
in with no attempt to conceal his anger.</p>

<p>“It has always been customary,” he said,
“to consult housemasters on matters of this
kind before raising them at a general meeting.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon lifted his eyebrows slightly,
but replied quite calmly: “I shall be glad to
consider any difficulties that may be put to
me in private; but, in a matter of this kind,
on which I feel very strongly, I must decide
for myself and in accordance with my own
judgment.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand,” cried Mr. Chowdler,
raising his voice and glaring at his chief,
“that we are to have this ill-considered ukase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
thrust down our throats without discussion?
Because, if so, let me say that that is an
indignity to which we are <i>not</i> accustomed.”</p>

<p>“I think I have made it clear,” said Mr.
Flaggon, “that I do not propose to take a vote
on this question, and I have stated my reasons:
I wish to see the experiment tried.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mr. Chowdler, turning
half round in his chair so as to face his
colleagues, “I, for one, shall decline to obey.”</p>

<p>“I have noted your refusal with extreme
regret,” replied Mr. Flaggon, so quietly that
the words would hardly have been heard
in the more distant parts of the room, if it had
not been for the intense silence that prevailed.
And then, before anybody had recovered from
the surprise and shock, he passed on to the
second item on the programme.</p>

<p>The rest of the business was dispatched
rapidly and without any of the irrelevant
comment which was usually a feature of
masters’ meetings. Everybody was anxious
to get away, to breathe the fresh air, and to
take stock of his own and other people’s
impressions.</p>

<p>“Chowdler’s downed him,” whispered Mr.
Rankin, as the masters trooped into the great
quadrangle with grave and anxious faces.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the younger man
thus addressed. “It can’t end there. And,”
he added, “it <i>ought</i> not to end there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Whether Mr. Chowdler felt any secret
misgivings, it is impossible to say. Probably
not. By dint of always speaking of “the
empty one” he had persuaded himself that
Mr. Flaggon was essentially a weak, unmeritable
man who was aping the despot.
Besides, Mr. Chowdler was not an adept at
self-criticism, and was quite incapable of
looking at himself from the outside. Presumably,
therefore, he regarded his display
of temper as an outburst of passionate but
righteousness indignation, a kind of prophetic
“Thus saith the Lord.” And, as the day
ended without further incident, he may have
thought, with Mr. Rankin, that the man
Flaggon was “downed.”</p>

<p>But, on the morrow, two things happened
which brought him face to face with some
very unpleasant facts. At first lesson a
notice came round to say that in future, on
Sunday afternoons, there would be preparation
in houses at 4.30 o’clock; and, later on
in the morning, he received a letter from the
headmaster couched in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chowdler</span>,</p>

<p>I have put off writing till to-day in
the hope that some word from you would
enable me to take a course different from the
one which the events of yesterday and your
subsequent silence compel me to pursue. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
hope that I shall never fear honest and outspoken
criticism. But there are decencies to
be observed without which a headmaster’s
position becomes impossible; and your behaviour
to myself yesterday leaves me no
alternative but to assume that you intended
deliberately to challenge my authority as
headmaster. It is with a grave sense of
responsibility and in no vindictive spirit that
I feel obliged to request you to send in your
resignation, to take effect at the end of the
present Term.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours faithfully,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">S. E. Flaggon</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The first effect of this letter on Mr.
Chowdler was to make him feel as if the solid
ground were crumbling away beneath him;
but, the next moment, his combative spirit
reasserted itself, and, dashing to his writing-table,
he scribbled off what he afterwards
described as “a calm and dignified reply.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I think we may speak to each other
in plain English. What you are pleased to
call a request for my resignation, <i>I</i> call a
notice of dismissal. I shall therefore exercise
my right of appeal (see “Statutes,” p. 131,
Schedule D, Clause 4). The Council must
decide between us.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours, etc.,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">H. Chowdler</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Mr. Flaggon verified the reference and
found that, by an old and unrepealed regulation,
Mr. Chowdler had indeed the right of
appeal to the Council against dismissal. He
therefore sent the following note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chowdler</span>,</p>

<p>I am informing the Chairman of the
Council of my decision and of the reasons
which have dictated it, by to-morrow evening’s
post at latest. You must take whatever
steps you think right.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours faithfully,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">S. E. Flaggon</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The fat, as at least half-a-dozen people said
spontaneously, was in the fire, and Chiltern
could think and talk of nothing else. There
was a general agreement that Chowdler’s
behaviour at the meeting had passed the
limits of decorum; but, while the seniors
maintained that the headmaster should have
ignored the offence in a man whose services
to the school were so notorious and of such
long standing, many of the juniors held that,
if Flaggon didn’t give old Chowdler the boot,
he was done for. There was an equal difference
of opinion as to the probable issue of the
appeal. The moderates thought that there
was still room for compromise. Chowdler
could withdraw his offensive remarks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
then Flaggon could withdraw his notice of
dismissal. Others, who knew Chowdler’s
love of battle, were sure that he would fight
it out to the end and win. Others, again, did
not see how the Council could possibly throw
over a headmaster whom they had so recently
appointed.</p>

<p>To Mr. Plummer the whole episode was
painful in the extreme, and the ideal of a
united staff seemed farther off than ever.
He was torn between two conflicting loyalties—loyalty
to an official chief, and loyalty to a
senior colleague. He expressed his inner
feelings to Mr. Bent on one of their frequent
walks, more from force of habit than because
he expected to find a sympathetic listener.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “one can’t defend
the way Chowdler <i>does</i> things; and nothing
could possibly have been worse than his
behaviour the other day. Still, one must
remember that he has had great provocation—<i>great</i>
provocation.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like you!” replied Mr. Bent.
“Chowdler is for trailing his coat across
the green, and when he succeeds in tripping
somebody, you say that he has had great provocation.
What provocation, pray! Name!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Plummer, “there was the
le Willow business to begin with.”</p>

<p>“A matter of principle,” said Mr. Bent.
“A headmaster who sacrificed his principles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a Chowdler, at the first summons, wouldn’t
be fit to be a crossing-sweeper!”</p>

<p>“And then there was his refusal to make
Cheeny Prefect,” said Mr. Plummer doggedly.</p>

<p>“Again a question of principle!” cried
his companion. “And you’re talking as if
Chowdler were the captain of the ship and
Flaggon his second mate.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” said Mr. Plummer. “But,
after Gussy, Chowdler’s position under a new
man was bound to be difficult, and Flaggon
ought to have made allowances; he ought
to have been more tactful.”</p>

<p>“Tact on Chowdler,” said Mr. Bent, “is
like a feather on a hippopotamus. Chowdler
doesn’t ask for tact; he demands unconditional
surrender.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” persisted Mr. Plummer, “though
he does it badly, Chowdler represents what
many, if not most, of us feel. You know I’m
not one of the people who go shouting their
criticisms on the house-tops: but, candidly,
I don’t approve of the new régime.”</p>

<p>“What don’t you approve of, pray?”
asked Mr. Bent scornfully. “The weeding out
of the old and incompetent? the attempt to
restore discipline? the——”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to particularise,” said
Mr. Plummer, “but I distrust Flaggon’s
whole attitude; especially in a man who has
no experience. The boys are discontented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the staff is divided, the numbers are down,
and we’re all wondering where it’s going to
end.”</p>

<p>“‘Ye fools and uncircumcised in heart and
mind,’” burst out Mr. Bent, “‘ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did,
so do ye.’”</p>

<p>“That’s blasphemous,” cried Mr. Plummer.</p>

<p>“I believe that’s what they said of Stephen,”
replied Mr. Bent, recovering his composure.
“But, as a matter of fact, I was quoting from
an unpublished letter of Lanchester’s; and
he happened to be speaking of an eighteenth-century
Chowdler.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>IN DARK PLACES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was obviously to the interest of all parties
that the appeal should be settled as soon as
possible. But the Council showed no haste
in coming to a decision. The delay was
ominous, for it seemed to indicate that they
regarded the question as an open one.</p>

<p>This being so, Mr. Pounderly and several
of his senior colleagues were anxious that the
staff should take combined action. There
was no doubt in Mr. Pounderly’s mind as to
what form the combined action should take.
“If,” he said, “the policy of cutting off the
heads of the tallest lilies receives official
sanction, it will not stop with Chowdler.
The lives and fortunes of all of us are at stake.
It is most important that at this crisis the
staff should show a united front.”</p>

<p>It took many hours of patient argument
to persuade Mr. Pounderly that the front of
the staff was not, and could not be, united;
and, when the unpalatable truth was at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
forced in upon him, he went about his daily
duties once more wringing his hands and
whispering, “lamentable, lamentable.”</p>

<p>However, he was to have an opportunity
of expressing his own views fully and in an
influential quarter. Mr. Benison-Benison, a
local magnate and a member of the Council,
had determined to get to the bottom of things
for himself. Mr. Benison-Benison was one
of those honest and incapable men whom the
British public delights to honour, and his
idea of getting to the bottom of things was to
give an impartial hearing to one side only.
It was the method he had always adopted in
forming his opinions on political or theological
questions; and he prided himself on his
freedom from prejudice. “I always make a
point of studying any controversial topic,” he
would say, “before I make up my mind about
it.” Consequently, when he set to work to
master the Chiltern problem, he could think
of no better way of doing so than by interviewing
personally Mr. Chowdler and his
friends. At much physical inconvenience to
himself, for he was crippled at the moment
by rheumatism, he drove over to Chiltern,
had a long talk with Mr. Chowdler, and, at
that gentleman’s suggestion, had separate
interviews also with Mr. Pounderly, Mr.
Black, Mr. Beadle, and some others of the
faction. And, as a result of it all, he carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
away “a very strong impression” that Mr.
Chowdler stood for the best interests of
the school, that Mr. Flaggon was the wrong
man in the wrong place, and that the masters,
as a body, would be very glad to see the last
of him. And this impression received a
striking corroboration from an entirely unprejudiced
quarter. Mr. Benison-Benison had
occasion to call, on his return journey, at
Thrale’s, the local motor and motor-cycle
shop; and, in answer to some discreet feelers,
Mr. Thrale became voluble and stated confidently
that Mr. Flaggon was letting down
the school “terrible” and ruining the town,
and that the citizens looked confidently to
the Council to set matters straight over “this
here appeal that they talk of.”</p>

<p>But, while the issue was still in doubt and
Chiltern was humming with excited gossip,
events occurred which turned all thoughts
for the moment into other channels.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase, acting on the advice of the
headmaster, had written in December to
the parents of three of his new boys, asking
them to find out, in the course of the holidays,
whether the moral tone of the house was
in a healthy condition; and, if anything
was wrong, to communicate confidentially
with him. In each case he had received
a formal acknowledgment of his letter, and,
as nothing further had come of it, his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
was at ease. And then, suddenly, a bolt
fell from the blue. Mr. Chase received one
morning an eight-page letter, marked private
and confidential, which made him turn very
pale and entirely took away his appetite
for breakfast. The writer of this letter related
that he had, during the holidays, put certain
questions to his son, and, after some pressing,
had extracted from him a story which showed
that, from the moral point of view, the school
generally and Mr. Chase’s house in particular
were in a very bad state. The boy, however,
had implored him not to say anything to
the authorities, as the two worst offenders
had left at Christmas and things were certain
to be much better next Term. He had,
however, by that morning’s post, received
a letter from his boy, which revived all his
anxieties. The boy wrote that he was very
unhappy and wanted to be taken away.
“Under these circumstances,” the father concluded,
“I feel bound, in the interests of
the school as well as of my own child, to
take you into my confidence; and I have
written you a full account of all that I know.
I only beg that, in whatever steps you take,
you will manage to keep my boy’s name
out of it. Dislike of being an informer,
and fear of the possible consequences to
himself, naturally weigh very heavily on
him. But, clearly, something must be done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and done at once; and, if you wish it, I am
quite prepared to come to Chiltern myself
and see you about the matter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase read the letter several times
with a strong sensation of physical nausea,
and sat for a while afterwards in his study
trying to think. When the first shock had
passed off, he began to cherish a hope that
the boy might perhaps have exaggerated.
Now that he came to think of it, it struck
him that the boy <i>was</i> rather an excitable
boy and, very likely, inclined to be hysterical.
But he was an honourable man; and, though
the facts, as related, were a reflection on his
own competence, he carried the letter straight
to the headmaster.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon guessed what must be passing
in his colleague’s mind, and his manner was
both sympathetic and cordial. He thanked
Mr. Chase warmly for having taken him at
once into his confidence; and, together, the
two men discussed what ought to be done.
Should the father be invited to come to
Chiltern and procure further and yet more
detailed information, or should they act
at once? Mr. Flaggon thought that there
was danger in delay. The boy might become
frightened and retract, or, possibly, give
a hint of what was brewing to a friend.
“Our best chance,” he said, “of getting at
the whole truth is to strike at once while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
the offenders are off their guard; and, if
the facts are as they have been stated, we
have enough to go upon. Besides, if the
father comes down and sees his son, everybody
will guess the source of our information;
and we are bound in honour to keep the
boy’s secret.” Mr. Chase agreed; and, accordingly,
that evening after locking up,
the headmaster went to Mr. Chase’s house
and held a searching inquiry. Before it
was over, he knew a great many things
that he had not known before, and realised
how very vile, under its deceptive light-heartedness,
life can be in a bad house in
a bad school.</p>

<p>Next morning, at first lesson, a rumour
spread through a startled school that three
of the most prominent Chaseites had been
summarily expelled, and that others were to
leave at the end of the Term: and Mr. Chase,
who looked as though all joy had gone out
of life, confirmed the news to his colleagues.
Mr. Flaggon had determined to address the
school that evening after chapel; but, before
he could do so, fresh developments occurred
which decided him to wait a little longer.
For, in the course of the day, Dennison, the
newly appointed Prefect, appeared in his study
with a pale face and twitching hands, and
asked if he might speak confidentially. The
permission was readily granted, and Dennison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
proceeded to unburden his soul. Everybody,
he said, had known for a long time that
Chase’s house was “rotten,” but he was afraid
his own house was not much better. Since
he had been Prefect, he thought there had
been an improvement; but, a week ago,
he heard of something which had made
him very miserable. He didn’t dare to tell
Mr. Chowdler; and, though he had been
within an ace, more than once, of asking the
headmaster for advice, he had never quite
made up his mind to do so. It was impossible
to get the Prefects to act together, because
a Prefect was himself involved, and the others
wouldn’t give him away. He had spent
sleepless nights worrying over the business;
but now he felt that he must make a clean
breast of the whole matter. He wanted to
do his duty; but he funked—there was
no other word for it—the deadly unpopularity
which was certain to be the result.</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon first talked the boy into a
calmer mood and then showed him, quietly
and sympathetically, what his duty was. He
must remove the seal of confidence and endure
the unpopularity. The moral welfare of
countless boys, present and to come, was at
stake. And so, before he left the study,
Dennison had braced himself to the most
difficult act of courage that a boy can be
called on to perform—namely, to defy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
traditional code of honour and to face social
ostracism.</p>

<p>An inquiry into Mr. Chowdler’s house was
necessarily a much more difficult business than
an inquiry into Mr. Chase’s. It was obviously
impossible for the headmaster to take Mr.
Chowdler into his confidence; so, boys had to
be sent for separately and interviewed in his
own study. There was much coming and
going, much leakage of knowledge and
consequent reticence or denial. Mr. Flaggon
felt that he had never sifted things quite to
the bottom. But Dennison stuck to his
guns; and, in the end, two boys, one of
whom was a Prefect, were expelled at once,
and four others were told that they must
leave at the end of the Term.</p>

<p>In the Prefect, Mr. Flaggon had long ago
recognised one of the three youths who had
impressed him so unfavourably on his first
visit to Chiltern. In spite of the clearest
evidence, this boy persisted in asserting his
innocence, and on hearing his sentence he
attempted a piece of insolent bluff.</p>

<p>“I shall appeal to Mr. Chowdler,” he said,
“and, if he keeps me, I shall stay.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon made no reply, but stepped
quickly to the telephone. “Number 92 A ...
is the police inspector in? ... no? will
he be in at six o’clock this evening?...
Thanks. I may have to give somebody into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
custody.... No thanks, there’s no immediate
hurry ... if I want him then, I’ll ring
him up.”</p>

<p>And before he had readjusted the receiver,
the boy, with a white face, blurted out,
“All right, sir, don’t do that. I’ll go at
once.” And he left the study with his tail
between his legs.</p>

<p>And on the following morning the school
were summoned into the Great Hall at
the end of first lesson and heard some
words which nobody ever forgot. Anybody
but Mr. Chowdler would have been overwhelmed
by the sudden discovery of his
own blindness; for, in the two boys who
had to leave so abruptly and for such
hideous offences, he had always seen the
true Chiltern type, the best product of the
Lanchester tradition. But Mr. Chowdler was
not an ordinary man. For a short time
indeed he did feel as if the solid ground were
crumbling again under his feet; but, within
a few days, he had persuaded himself, first,
that if there <i>had</i> been mischief in his house
it was because “the man Flaggon” had taken
the control of it out of the proper hands;
secondly, that boys had been bullied into
confessing to crimes that they had never committed;
and, thirdly, that there had been a
great deal of hysteria and exaggeration about
the whole business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>On this occasion, however, Mr. Chowdler
found but few disciples. Mr. Flaggon’s
prompt and fearless handling of the affair,
the words which he had spoken to the school,
his genuine hatred of the evil thing and, with
it all, his buoyant faith in the ultimate triumph
of good influences, had made a deep impression
on the masters. They realised that, in
spite of youth and inexperience, the new headmaster
was a man; and not a few of them
felt that they had themselves been culpably
blind.</p>

<p>“It’s no good,” said one of the younger
men, who taught a low form in the school,
“it’s no good saying that we didn’t see and
couldn’t be expected to see. We <i>ought</i> to
have seen; the evidence was all around us.
Why, there are three kids in my form—new
last Term—who are different men since this
came out; different in their work and their
manner and everything. It’s like people
waking up from a nightmare.”</p>

<p>“And there’s one in my form,” said Mr.
Rankin, “who goes about looking as if he
were going to be hanged. I guess he’s got
something pretty heavy on his conscience,
and he’s mortally afraid of being swept into
the net.”</p>

<p>But there was one point on which opinion
was not so unanimous. What would be the
effect on the reputation of the school of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
these drastic expulsions? Would not intending
parents take fright? With numbers
already down, was this root-and-branch
method altogether wise—and was it really
necessary?</p>

<p>Mr. Plummer shared these doubts; and
he expressed them to Mr. Bent as they stood,
one bleak afternoon in March, on the Sow’s
Back, looking over a grey and cheerless
landscape.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “I recognise that
Flaggon has come out of all this extraordinarily
well, and has taught us all a great
deal. Nothing, I’m sure, could have been
more impressive than the way he spoke
to the school, and I shall remember it as
long as I live. But, I must say, I don’t
quite like this relentless pruning. Five
boys on the spot, and ten more at the
end of the Term! It looks as if we were
forgetting that it’s our duty to save as well
as to punish.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Mr. Bent; “the parable of
the lost sheep. But that parable, my dear
Plummer, was never meant for schoolmasters;
<i>we</i> need to be reminded of our duty to the
ninety and nine—we’re always ready enough
to play the rôle of good shepherd. Besides,
you know the sequel.”</p>

<p>“What sequel?” asked Mr. Plummer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know,” replied Mr. Bent, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
a month afterwards the lost sheep, having
acquired a taste for adventures, trotted off
into the wilderness again, taking with him this
time the rest of the flock, twenty-five per
cent. of whom got eaten by wolves and never
were heard of more? No, my dear Plummer,
it’s too risky.”</p>

<p>“But one <i>must</i> take risks,” insisted Mr.
Plummer, “if one is to do anything that is
worth doing: and, to refuse to take risks
when there’s a chance of saving anybody
seems to me sheer cowardice.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes,” said Mr. Bent, “true enough, if
the risk were <i>our</i> risk—a danger to you and
me. But it isn’t. The danger is to the
other boys—the boys who are here and the
boys who are coming. If you want to make a
public school a reformatory, you ought to be
honest with the parents; you ought to say
to them frankly, ‘I am keeping such and
such boys, whom I know to be dangerous,
because I think that the companionship of
<i>your</i> son may possibly do them good.’ What
d’you suppose the parents would say to
that? What d’you imagine any of <i>our</i>
married colleagues would say, if you proposed
to plant a reformatory lad in the middle of
their young families, because you felt sure it
would be good for <i>him</i> and you weren’t
going to be scared by the risks? Answer
me that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“There are reformatories and reformatories,”
replied Mr. Plummer sententiously.
“Anyhow,” he added, as the dust-laden wind
swept down the road, “the prospect is gloomy—and
I shouldn’t wonder if we had some
snow.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE DAY OF DECISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, a week after this conversation,
Mr. Bent received a summons to see the
headmaster in his study after dinner; so,
putting on his great-coat, for the wind was
still blowing keenly from the north-east, he
repaired to the Prætorium. Mr. Flaggon was
seated at his table, writing letters, but he
waved his guest into an armchair and
wheeled his own chair round to face the fire.</p>

<p>“I have to make arrangements for next
Term,” he began, with an abruptness that
was characteristic. “I am assuming that
I shall be here and that Chowdler will have
gone. In that case I want you to take his
house.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bent was not altogether unprepared
for his offer, though he had never allowed
his thoughts to dwell much on the subject.
He paused for a few moments before
replying:</p>

<p>“It won’t be a bed of roses—at least at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
first; but a year ago I should not have
hesitated for a moment. To-day I know
my limitations better, and I am not sure
whether I have the necessary qualities.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon eyed him keenly for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>“I think you are more fitted for the post
than anyone else here—if you will follow
your better nature.”</p>

<p>“Then I will do my best,” said Mr. Bent,
“and trust that my better nature will pull
me through.”</p>

<p>There was a pause before Mr. Flaggon
began again, somewhat hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“I think, perhaps, that it would be better
if this matter were kept private between us
two—for the present at all events. I am
thinking chiefly of your own position.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” said Mr. Bent, “that, if
certain things happen, I shall cut a better
figure if I am found seated on the top of
the fence than if I have come down definitely
on the wrong side.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flaggon smiled. “I suppose I meant
something of the kind,” he said, “though
I didn’t put it to myself quite in that way.
The truth is that I am not at all sure about
the future. I have every right to assume that
the Council will support me against Chowdler;
but, strictly between ourselves, they seem
to be hesitating, and I have been approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
lately with suggestions of a compromise.
I can accept no compromise. Its not a
question of my own dignity—though a public
man has to consider that too: but, if I am
not to be headmaster <i>de facto</i> as well as
<i>de jure</i>, I can serve no useful purpose by
remaining here; and I shall go.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mr. Bent, “there is
no need for secrecy; for, if you go, I shall
go too.”</p>

<p>The headmaster coloured slightly. Ever
since he had been at Chiltern, and especially
in the last few weeks, he had felt his isolation
and aloofness as no inconsiderable part of
the burden. The sudden sense of fellowship
sent a warm glow through his veins; but he
repressed his emotion and replied gravely:</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t do that; you mustn’t
do that. It is quite unnecessary, and it
would damage the school.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bent got up from his chair, and, all
unconsciously, began to pace about the room.
His feelings were such that he could not
express them adequately in a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“I’m not speaking on the spur of the
moment,” he began. “My mind was made
up long before I came into this study and
received your offer. For fifteen years I’ve
lived in an atmosphere of bunkum and make-believe
that have no relation to facts. That
kind of thing is bound to make a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
either a humbug or a cynic. It has very
nearly made me a cynic; and, though it’s
very amusing to be a cynic, it isn’t good
for one’s immortal soul. If one’s to be a
live man, one must have something definite
to do—something that one can believe in and
work for. I <i>can</i> appreciate and work for
your ideals—decency, order, and an education
that—that is educational. I know that I
shan’t approve of all your methods—I’m
Oxford, and much too critical for that—and
you won’t expect it of me. But I cannot
endure to sink back again into unreality.
I have enough to live on; not much but
enough; and I can always get work—tutoring
or anything. But I <i>will</i> not face another
fifteen years of the off-theory and Chowdler’s
version of the Lanchester tradition. I say,”
he added suddenly, “I must apologise. In
my excitement I’ve been forgetting my
manners.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands warmly at
parting, and Mr. Flaggon was betrayed into
something that very closely resembled a
confidence.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “the long delay <i>is</i>
rather trying.”</p>

<p>But the long delay was coming to an end,
and the day of decision was fixed at last.
Mr. Flaggon learnt it from the Chairman
of the Council; Mr. Chowdler and the masters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
were informed “privately and confidentially”
by Mr. Benison-Benison, and the boys heard
of it from the masters’ wives.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fateful day, Mr.
Flaggon looked down the long rows of bowed
heads in chapel with peculiar feelings. He
was something of a fatalist, believing, as
he did, that there is special Providence in
the fall of a sparrow, and that a man is
false to his duty, however hazardous that
duty may be, if he allows himself to dwell
on the possibility of failure. But he could
not help wondering, that morning, whether
he would ever sit in his place again and feel
that his life’s work lay there before him, and
that he had the power to do it. In the last
few weeks Chiltern had become to him something
much more concrete than it had been
before, something that stirred his affections
and appealed to his sympathy. While
searching in dark places for the roots of the
parasite that was strangling the life of the
place, he had discovered the germs of much
that was healthy and even noble—individual
heroisms, boys ready, at a moment’s call,
to do a man’s work, knees which in the face
of fierce temptation had never bowed to
Baal; and, with all its capacity for evil,
he had realised the immense possibilities
for good in schoolboy nature. He was
conscious, too, of a change of attitude on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the part of the staff. Rather shyly, rather
awkwardly, many, especially the younger
men, had made it clear to him by voice and
manner and gesture that they were with him.
There was an irony in the fate which might
give him the summons to quit at the very
moment when he had secured a firm grip
of the school and proved his right to rule.
<i>Might</i> give? Very probably <i>would</i> give;
for, in his heart of hearts, he had no great
faith in the Council that was to pronounce
judgment.</p>

<p>And, a few hours later, the councillors
were assembling at Grandborough to decide
between the headmaster and his rebellious
lieutenant. Most of them had come with
their minds more than half made up. That
Mr. Chowdler’s conduct had exceeded the
courtesies of debate there could be no doubt;
and, under ordinary circumstances, they would
have been shy of interfering between a headmaster
and one of his assistants. But the
circumstances were not ordinary; and the men
who were called upon to judge them were
much influenced by the opinion, commonly
expressed in Society (with a capital S),
that the new headmaster was a failure and
was letting the school down rapidly. They
gathered, too, from Mr. Benison-Benison that
this was also the opinion of the masters.
And, again, they had been much alarmed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the recent troubles. Rumour had put the
number of expulsions at 150; and, though
the councillors were now in possession of
the correct figures, the impression remained
that Chiltern, which had once seemed to
be founded on a rock, was crumbling away
before their very eyes.</p>

<p>“How do you intend to vote?” said
Canon Braintree to Sir Arthur Tysoe, as
they entered the assembly room at the
“Blue Boar,” which always served as Council chamber.</p>

<p>“I shall vote,” said Sir Arthur, “for any
compromise that will save the assistant; he
seems to be the better man. And you?”</p>

<p>“I shall vote against the headmaster,”
replied the Canon; “of course, it will mean
his resignation, and may make us look a
little foolish in the eyes of the world. Still,
when one has made a mistake, the most
courageous course is to undo it as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>When the councillors had got through
a little preliminary chatting, they took their
seats round the long mahogany table and
the Chairman opened the proceedings.</p>

<p>“The business before us to-day,” he began,
“is to consider an appeal from the Rev.
Henry Chowdler, assistant master at Chiltern,
against a notice of dismissal, received from
the headmaster on the 15th of February<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
last, to take effect on and after the 7th of
April proximo. In accordance with Schedule
D, Clause 4 of the ‘Statutes and Regulations,’
‘any housemaster, or other master, not
being a dancing, writing or fencing master,
who shall have completed fifteen years of
continuous service on the staff’ possesses
this right. As Mr. Chowdler is one of the
boarding-house masters at Chiltern and the
headmaster has confirmed the notice of dismissal
in writing to your Chairman, the
appeal is in order. But you are no doubt
aware that, under Schedule E, Clause 7,
sub-section <i>b</i>, the Council is empowered to
refuse cognisance of such an appeal, if it
so thinks fit. This is a curious provision,
and was inserted, I believe, at a time when
Dr. Lanchester, who enjoyed the entire confidence
of his Council, was having trouble
with his staff. The first question therefore
before us is, whether or no the Council
will accept cognisance of the Rev. Henry
Chowdler’s appeal; and our decision in no
way prejudices any subsequent action we
may take when, and if, we proceed to consider
the appeal on its own merits.”</p>

<p>The Chairman had rattled off his opening
remarks with the volubility of a man who is
accustomed to get through business quickly.
He paused for breath and was about to add
that, as the motion was presumably a merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
formal one, he supposed there was no need
for discussing it, when the Bishop intervened.</p>

<p>Somebody has said that no cause is
irretrievably doomed until the Bishop of
Grandborough has made it his own. Like all
epigrams, this statement is only partially
true; for the Bishop has championed many
winning causes, good as well as bad. But
his warmest admirers admit that, as a leader,
he is more successful in putting heart into his
followers than in winning over waverers.</p>

<p>“Technically,” he began, “our Chairman is
correct, and the motion does not prejudge
the main issue; but, practically, it raises at
once, and in an acute form, the question of
confidence or no confidence in the headmaster.
If we had merely to decide between Mr.
Flaggon and Mr. Chowdler, there could be
no doubt as to what our decision would be;
for every man in authority has a right to be
supported against unruly subordinates. But
we have not met here to judge between Mr.
Flaggon and his subordinate. We are all
aware that we have met to decide whether
it is right or expedient that Mr. Flaggon
should continue to be headmaster at all.
That is an unfortunate position for us to be in,
and, if my advice had been taken last July,
we should have avoided it. But we must
take the situation as we find it and face it
boldly. In my opinion Mr. Flaggon ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
never to have been appointed and ought
not now to be continued in his office; and I
have with me convincing proofs to clinch my
argument.”</p>

<p>Here the Bishop produced a large blue
magazine, and held it up to show that there
was no deception.</p>

<p>“In this magazine,” he continued, tapping
the cover, “there is an article by the Rev.
Septimus Flaggon, entitled ‘Inspiration.’
When it was first brought to my notice, some
weeks ago, I wrote at once to Mr. Flaggon to
ask him whether he acknowledged the alleged
authorship, and, if so, whether he was prepared
to disavow certain passages in it, which I
had marked with a blue pencil. Mr. Flaggon
replied that the article in question had been
written several years ago, but that, after
re-reading it carefully, he saw nothing in it to
retract. That being so, I propose to read you
certain passages, from which you will be able
to judge for yourselves whether the writer
is a man who can safely be entrusted with
the spiritual guidance of the young in a Church
of England school.”</p>

<p>The Chairman here pointed out that Mr.
Flaggon’s theological opinions were irrelevant
to the question at issue, namely, whether or
no the Council should take cognisance of Mr.
Chowdler’s appeal. But the Bishop was not
to be stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“You will see the relevance,” he said,
“when I have finished.” And he proceeded
to read out the incriminating passages. To
about half the Council they seemed of the
mildest and most harmless nature; and one
of the members said bluntly:</p>

<p>“I see no reason why a headmaster should
not hold these views, and preach them too
if he likes. If we are going to begin heresy-hunting,
I believe we shall make a grave
mistake.”</p>

<p>The discussion, having once been launched
on these troubled waters, was developed at
great length and with ever-increasing acrimony.
Inspiration was a subject which Mr. Benison-Benison
had made his own and on which
other members of the Council felt strongly.
In vain the Chairman tried to recall the
meeting to the real point at issue. He had
to give way before the demands of human
nature, and accept the inevitable. When at
last the question was put, the voting went
on strictly theological lines; with the result
that the numbers for and against were exactly
equal.</p>

<p>The Chairman hesitated. On the one
hand he saw the unwisdom of practically
installing Mr. Chowdler as permanent Mayor
of the Palace at Chiltern. On the other hand,
if Mr. Flaggon were going to empty the school,
the financial situation would become difficult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and it might be better to do at once, what
would probably have to be done later—namely,
force his resignation.</p>

<p>The Bishop noted his hesitation, shrugged
his shoulders impatiently, and whispered
something to his neighbour. The words were
inaudible, but the Chairman guessed their
purport and his hesitation vanished.</p>

<p>“The question before us,” he said, “being
whether or no the Council will take cognisance
of the appeal of the Rev. Henry Chowdler,
and the ayes and noes being equally divided,
I cast my vote in favour of the noes. As we
have no further business to transact, the
Council is adjourned to the 21st of June next,
when I hope that the plans and estimates
for the new sheds and pig-stye, to be erected
on the boundary field, will be ready for
approval.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>AFTERMATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chowdler</span> took the blow standing.
“What else could you expect,” he said
contemptuously, “from such a Council! Like
master, like man!” He did not even break
down when his house gave him an ovation
at prayers, such as might have greeted
a conqueror. It was not so much a
demonstration against the headmaster as
a display of tribal loyalty to a fallen chief;
and it had its touch of chivalry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chowdler was completely bewildered.
She could not understand how anybody, having
to choose between Harry and that dreadful
Mr. Flaggon, could fail to choose Harry.
But she played up to her husband nobly.
“Of course,” she said, “we never expected
anything else; but Harry felt that it was
his duty to give the Council a last chance of
saving the school. They have rejected it,
and that is the end of Chiltern.” Needless to
say, nobody contradicted her, and she was
the object of much silent sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Some people supposed, and many hoped,
that, when the verdict was given against him,
Mr. Chowdler would leave at once or at least
withdraw from active life; and the headmaster
allowed it to be known in the Chowdler
circle, through Mr. Chase, that if such a step
were contemplated everything would be done
to make it easy. But Mr. Chowdler preferred
to die fighting. In deference to the entreaties
of his friends, he did indeed absent himself
from masters’ meetings; but, otherwise, his
presence was as much felt, his voice as often
heard, as ever. No martyr has ever stood at
the stake with a prouder or more defiant mien.</p>

<p>Now a martyrdom is always an unpleasant
business for others than the victim; and one
of the spectators who felt the unpleasantness
most acutely was Mr. Bent. Mr. Bent repudiated
the title of sportsman, but he had
scruples and susceptibilities of his own. As
unacknowledged heir to Mr. Chowdler’s house
he found his position a delicate one, and he
hesitated to proclaim his right to the succession
while Mr. Chowdler was so very much
alive. It would have been comparatively
easy to speak the word while the battle was
still raging and the issue in doubt; but he
had missed the psychological moment, and
to speak it now, smacked too much of a mean
triumph over a fallen foe. Therefore, when
people wondered in his presence who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
succeed to the house, he held his peace and
felt a little like a boy who had committed
an offence and fears to own up to it. The
situation was particularly awkward, because
it was high time that he should be making
arrangements for moving in; and the holidays
were short.</p>

<p>His friend Plummer put a finger, inadvertently,
one afternoon on the raw place
and received a disagreeable shock.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said, “who will get
Chowdler’s house. It’s very tactful of Flaggon
to keep it in abeyance; but he’ll <i>have</i> to make
the appointment soon—certainly before the end
of Term.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’ll be <i>me</i>,” said Mr. Bent,
colouring slightly.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Mr. Plummer in a
voice of genuine alarm. “You’re joking, I
hope.”</p>

<p>“Why impossible, pray?” asked Mr. Bent,
in tones of unusual chilliness.</p>

<p>“Why, because ...” replied Mr. Plummer
irritably, “... it’s really very difficult to
explain ... but of all people you’re the
very last who ought to succeed Chowdler.
Think what people would say!”</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> would they say?” asked Mr. Bent
doggedly.</p>

<p>The task of enlightening an obtuse friend
as to what people are saying of him is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
delicate one; and Mr. Plummer couldn’t
help thinking that Bent was singularly and
unexpectedly obtuse.</p>

<p>“Well, of course,” he began, “it <i>has</i> been
said by ill-natured people—when you became
a Flaggonite, you know, and seemed to be
seeing a good deal of him, that.... Well,
in fact, that you had an axe of your own to
grind, and wanted——”</p>

<p>“The women, I suppose,” interrupted Mr.
Bent.</p>

<p>“I expect so,” Mr. Plummer admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bent had always suspected that something
of this kind would be said. But it is
one thing to have disagreeable suspicions,
and another to hear them confirmed. He
looked pained, and said after a short pause:</p>

<p>“And do you believe it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” cried Mr. Plummer.
“Nobody who knows you would believe anything
so ridiculous for the moment.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see why I should mind,”
said Mr. Bent.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” protested Mr.
Plummer, “you can surely see ... and then
there are the boys. Have you thought about
them? Everybody knows—or at least thinks—that
you have a special ‘down’ on that
house; and the boys——”</p>

<p>“You mean they’ll fight?” suggested Mr.
Bent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Undoubtedly,” replied his friend.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Mr. Bent. “Excellent!
Then there’ll <i>be</i> a fight; that’s all. It will
be the making of me; and, by the Lord
Harry, I’ll smash ’em.”</p>

<p>There was only one other incident in the
Term that could be called at all sensational.
At the last masters’ meeting, about a week
before the holidays, Mr. Flaggon distributed
some printed papers, which were found to
be a rough draft of the summer hours for
Sunday, and a proposed new curriculum.
“I meant you to have these before,” he said,
“but I fear I have been too busy. I propose to
discuss the whole question early next Term.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beadle buried his head in his hands
but said nothing; and almost everybody
felt a slight shock of pained surprise. This
was surely pushing the claims of the conqueror
ungenerously far! They had accepted their
new headmaster—had even begun to discover
qualities in him which extorted admiration.
But they expected that he, in his turn, would
make concessions, come at least part of the
way to meet them; whereas, to choose this
particular moment for securing their tacit
assent to disputed principles, seemed an
unfair use of a delicate situation and
peculiar circumstances. And it was inevitable
that they should think so; for, as Mr.
Bent observed, they could not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
that what they were willing to accept as the
end, was to Mr. Flaggon only the beginning.</p>

<p>The remaining days of the Term lingered
like an unwelcome guest who does not know
how to take his leave. Everybody was
nervously anxious to have got through without
further shocks or excitement, to close a
tragic chapter and plunge into the waters of
oblivion before beginning a new page. For
the strain of the past weeks had been almost
intolerable.</p>

<p>And the end came at length, and in a
gloom that made the last chapel seem like
a funeral service. Dotted about among the
congregation were the boys who were leaving
under a cloud, and, in his stall on the
south wall of the nave, sat Mr. Chowdler,
red, unhappy, and defiant. Though he was
convinced of the necessity, Mr. Flaggon could
not but feel the pity of it all; indeed, for a
moment, he experienced the sensations of a
humane executioner in the presence of his
victims. And worse was to come. For, as
he knelt for the last time in the school chapel,
Mr. Chowdler was suddenly overpowered by
his emotions, and his broad shoulders shook
with the sobs that he was powerless to control.
It was not remorse; it was not even regret
for anything he had done. Something there
was of the bitterness of defeat, and something
of the grief of a sanguine man who has lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
an only child. Mr. Chowdler had loved
Chiltern with all the strength of a robust
and unimaginative nature; and, in a few
short months, he had seen his roots in the
past and his heritage in the future destroyed,
utterly and for ever. The holy places had
been defiled and Jerusalem made a heap of
stones.</p>

<p>The headmaster saw and understood;
and he had to make an unusual effort before
he was able to pronounce the blessing.</p>

<p>With the departure of Mr. Chowdler the
Lanchester tradition, according to one school
of thought, received its death-blow. According
to another, it was really disinterred and
given a new lease of life; and a pamphlet
containing some hitherto unpublished letters
of the great man, which can be obtained at
the school stationer’s, lends some colour to
this view.</p>

<p>What Mr. Flaggon made of Chiltern and
how Mr. Bent fared with his house, may,
possibly, be told hereafter. For the present
we will leave them to fight out their battles
under the eyes of watchful colleagues and the
shadow of Dr. Lanchester’s statue in the
great quadrangle.</p>
